  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online that looked stunning in the pictures, but it arrived and was completely different in color and fit. \n\nThe service at the restaurant was painfully slow, and when the food finally arrived, it was cold and undercooked.\n\nI reached out to customer support about my billing issue, and they were incredibly unhelpful. I’m still trying to sort it out.\n\nI loved the concept of the app, but it crashes every time I try to upload a photo. What a waste of time!\n\nAfter waiting over an hour for our reservation, we were told the kitchen had run out of our main dish. Absolutely unacceptable.\n\nI signed up for the subscription service expecting great content, but the selection is disappointing and hardly updated.\n\nThe flight was delayed for three hours with no explanation, and we were just left sitting in the terminal. \n\nI found the staff at the store to be dismissive and uninterested in helping me find what I needed. \n\nI was excited to try the new café, but the coffee tasted burnt and the pastries were stale. \n\nI received a damaged item from my online order, and the return process was more complicated than expected.\n\nThe misleading advertisement showed a luxurious experience, but what we got was far from it. \n\nI was promised a refund within five days, but it’s been two weeks, and I still haven’t seen a dime.\n\nThe app is supposed to help me track my fitness, but it keeps deleting my progress. Very frustrating!\n\nI was disappointed with the quality of the product; it felt cheap and not worth the price at all.\n\nThe hotel room was not clean upon arrival, and when I requested a new one, it took forever to get assistance.\n\nMy last experience with your customer service was awful. They didn’t listen to my issue and seemed annoyed I called.\n\nI had high hopes for this new restaurant, but the service was so rude that I won’t be coming back.\n\nThe travel package I purchased promised luxury but delivered a cramped bus and basic accommodations. \n\nI can’t believe I waited on hold for 45 minutes only to be transferred to someone who couldn’t help me.\n\nThe snacks in my subscription box were stale and unappetizing. I expected better quality.\n\nI ordered a pizza that was supposed to have extra toppings, but it arrived barely covered. Very disappointing!\n\nI tried the new fitness class, but the instructor was unenthusiastic and the session felt very rushed.\n\nThe website was confusing and hard to navigate; I almost gave up trying to place my order.\n\nThe staff at the hotel were friendly, but the room was noisy and not what I expected for the price.\n\nI was really let down by the concert I attended; the sound quality was terrible and the venue felt overcrowded.\n\nI bought a pair of shoes that were advertised as comfortable, but they gave me blisters after just one wear.\n\nThe delivery took much longer than promised, and when it arrived, the package was damaged.\n\nI was shocked at how unprofessional the staff were during my visit. It felt like they didn’t care about the customers.\n\nThe promotional email I received was misleading; the sale wasn’t as great as it sounded.\n\nI used the app for a week, but it kept freezing and was more trouble than it was worth.\n\nThe service at the restaurant was lackluster, and we felt ignored throughout our meal.\n\nI expected a quick resolution to my issue, but the support team kept putting me on hold.\n\nI purchased a product that was supposed to be easy to use, but I found it incredibly complicated and frustrating.\n\nThe cruise was marketed as a relaxing getaway, but the noise levels and crowded spaces made it anything but.\n\nI was disappointed with the portion sizes at the restaurant; I left still feeling hungry.\n\nThe online course promised expert instruction, but the content was basic and not very engaging.\n\nI had a terrible experience with the airline; my luggage was lost, and no one seemed to care.\n\nI tried contacting support about a billing issue, but they were dismissive and did not offer any real solutions.\n\nThe new phone app kept crashing, making it impossible to access my account. \n\nThe food at the event was bland and lacked variety; I expected much better for the price of admission.\n\nI was unhappy with the way my complaint was handled; it felt like my concerns were brushed aside.\n\nI thought I was getting a great deal, but the product I received was defective and unusable. \n\nThe customer service representative was polite but ultimately unable to resolve my issue. Very frustrating!"
