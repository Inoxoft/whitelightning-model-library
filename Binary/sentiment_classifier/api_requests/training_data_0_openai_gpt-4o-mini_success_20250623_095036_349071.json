  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "The shirt I received was nothing like the picture online, completely misleading.  \nI waited over an hour for my food, and it was cold when it finally arrived.  \nThe customer service representative was more interested in their phone than helping me.  \nI’m really disappointed; the app keeps crashing, and I can’t access my account.  \nThis subscription service is a waste of money; I hardly use it, and they make cancellation impossible.  \nThe hotel I booked was dirty and not at all what was advertised.  \nI’ve contacted support three times, and no one seems to know how to help me.  \nThe coffee was burnt, and the staff acted like it was my fault for ordering it.  \nI was charged for a product I never received, and no one is responding to my emails.  \nThe movie I rented wouldn’t play, and the customer service was unhelpful and rude.  \nI expected fresh ingredients, but the salad I got had wilted leaves.  \nThe flight was delayed without any explanation, leaving us stranded at the airport.  \nI was excited about the new features in the app, but they don’t work as advertised.  \nI’m frustrated that the store didn’t honor the sale price I saw online.  \nThe staff at the restaurant seemed overwhelmed and forgot my order entirely.  \nI’ve had better service at a fast food joint; this place is overrated.  \nThe online booking process was confusing, and I ended up with the wrong dates.  \nI’m really unhappy with the quality of the product; it broke after one use.  \nThe delivery was late, and the package arrived damaged. Not impressed at all.  \nI tried to return the item, but the process was so complicated it made me give up.  \nI feel misled by the advertising; this product does not perform as claimed.  \nI was hoping for a great experience, but the staff were dismissive and unhelpful.  \nI ordered a vegan meal, but they served me something with cheese.  \nThe noise level in the hotel was unbearable; I couldn’t sleep at all.  \nI’m not sure how this place has good reviews; my meal was tasteless and undercooked.  \nI had to wait on hold for 30 minutes just to get a simple question answered.  \nThe website is not user-friendly, and I ended up frustrated trying to check out.  \nI thought I was getting a good deal, but the product quality is subpar.  \nThe tour guide seemed disinterested; we barely learned anything.  \nThe promised delivery within two days turned into a week-long wait.  \nI received the wrong item and getting a refund has been a nightmare.  \nMy experience at the restaurant was soured by the rude behavior of the waitstaff.  \nI’m disappointed; the app is glitchy and constantly logs me out.  \nThe vacation package was not worth it; the accommodations were below standards.  \nI expected better customer service from a brand with such a good reputation.  \nThe product was advertised as waterproof, but it got soaked in the rain.  \nThe hotel amenities were not as described; the pool was closed during our stay.  \nI’m frustrated with how difficult it is to reach someone for support.  \nThe food was overpriced for the quality we received; I won’t be coming back.  \nEvery time I try to use the app, it crashes, making it nearly impossible to enjoy.  \nI was excited to try the new dish, but it was bland and poorly presented.  \nThe constant pop-ups on the website made shopping a hassle.  \nI had to chase down my waiter just to get the check; service was painfully slow.  \nI wasn’t impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant; it felt unsanitary.  \nThe product arrived late and was damaged; I won’t order from here again.  \nThe wait for my order took forever, and nobody communicated with us.  \nI expected a more luxurious experience given the high price, but it fell flat.  \nThe staff seemed untrained and confused; it made the experience frustrating.  \nI received a defective item, and getting a replacement has been a hassle.  \nThe event was poorly organized; we missed half the activities due to delays.  \nI tried to cancel my subscription, but the process was intentionally complicated.  \nThe quality of the service has really declined; I won’t be returning.  \nI was shocked by how unprofessional the staff were; it ruined our evening."
