  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress for a wedding, but it arrived two sizes too small. How does that even happen? \n\nThe food at the restaurant was cold and tasteless. I expected more for the price we paid. \n\nI tried to get help from customer support, but they just kept transferring me to different departments. So frustrating! \n\nThe app keeps crashing every time I try to use it. I’m about ready to delete it. \n\nI was promised free shipping, but I ended up paying extra at checkout. Very misleading! \n\nThe hotel room was nothing like the pictures online. I feel completely cheated. \n\nI waited over an hour for my order, and when it finally arrived, it was wrong. What a letdown! \n\nI’ve been a subscriber for a year, but the service has become so unreliable. I’m considering canceling. \n\nThe staff at the store were rude and unhelpful. I won’t be coming back anytime soon. \n\nMy last flight was delayed for three hours, and there was no communication from the airline. Absolutely unacceptable! \n\nThe product broke within a week of purchase. I expected better quality for the price. \n\nI tried to return an item, but the process was so complicated. I gave up in the end. \n\nThe website kept crashing while I was trying to place my order. It was incredibly annoying! \n\nI ordered a coffee, and it tasted burnt. I couldn’t finish it. \n\nThe movie streaming service keeps buffering, and I have a fast internet connection. It’s infuriating! \n\nI was really disappointed with the customer service. They didn’t seem to care about my issue at all. \n\nI booked a tour that was supposed to be guided, but we ended up wandering around alone. Total waste of money. \n\nI received an email about a sale, but when I went to the store, nothing was on sale. Just false advertising. \n\nThe delivery was late, and I missed an important event because of it. Extremely frustrating! \n\nI tried to make a reservation online, but the system was down. Very inconvenient! \n\nThe product arrived damaged, and the return process took forever. I won’t order again. \n\nI had high hopes for this restaurant, but the service was slow and the food was mediocre. \n\nThe app doesn’t work as advertised. I feel misled and disappointed. \n\nI ordered a gift for my friend’s birthday, and it arrived late—such an embarrassment! \n\nI’ve reached out multiple times about my issue, and I still haven’t received a response. \n\nThe hotel staff were unprofessional and seemed overwhelmed. Not a pleasant stay. \n\nI was promised a full refund, but I only received a partial amount. Quite frustrating! \n\nI ordered a pizza that was supposed to be loaded with toppings, but it was mostly cheese. \n\nThe tour guide was disorganized, and we missed half the attractions. \n\nI received a broken item and the customer service rep didn’t even apologize. \n\nThe promotional offer I saw was nowhere to be found when I tried to redeem it. \n\nThe online class was poorly organized, and the instructor barely engaged with us. \n\nI made a complaint about my last visit, but I never heard back from management. Very disappointing. \n\nThe delivery driver was rude and seemed rushed. Not the best experience. \n\nI bought a pair of shoes, and they started falling apart after just a few weeks. \n\nI expected a lot more from this app; it’s just not user-friendly at all. \n\nThe food was overpriced for the quality we received. I won’t return. \n\nI waited two weeks for my order, only to receive the wrong item. \n\nThe staff didn’t seem knowledgeable about the products they were selling. \n\nThe subscription service keeps sending me items I didn’t order. \n\nI was treated poorly by the waiter, and it really ruined our dinner. \n\nThe concert venue was far too crowded, and it made for a very uncomfortable experience. \n\nI found the product description misleading; it didn’t match what I received at all. \n\nI had to wait ages for my carry-on at the baggage claim. \n\nThe customer support chat was unhelpful and left me more confused than before. \n\nI signed up for a trial, but they charged me full price before I even got to try it. \n\nThe room I booked was not available when I arrived, and they had no alternatives. \n\nThe service was incredibly slow, and I almost left before my food arrived. \n\nI tried to leave a review on their website, but it wouldn’t go through. \n\nThe tour was supposed to include lunch; instead, we got a granola bar. \n\nI expected a better experience given all the positive reviews, but I was really let down."
