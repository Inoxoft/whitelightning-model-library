  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online, and it arrived two sizes too small. What a waste of time and money!  \nThe service at the restaurant was painfully slow, and the food was cold when it finally arrived.  \nI can't believe how unhelpful the customer support team was. They didn't solve my issue at all.  \nThe app crashes every time I try to log in. I’m seriously considering deleting it.  \nI’m really disappointed with my subscription box. It’s not worth the price I’m paying.  \nThe flight was delayed for hours, and the staff offered no explanation or assistance.  \nI received a product that was clearly used and not as described. This is unacceptable!  \nThe hotel promised a sea view, but all I got was a view of the parking lot.  \nMy order was missing items, and no one seems to care to resolve it.  \nThe food was bland and overpriced. I expected much better for the rave reviews.  \nI feel misled by the advertisement. The product does not perform as promised at all.  \nThe app is so buggy, it’s almost unusable. I’m frustrated every time I try to use it.  \nThe staff at the store were dismissive and rude when I asked for help.  \nI waited on hold for over an hour, only to be cut off. This is ridiculous!  \nThe customer service experience was a nightmare. I won't be shopping here again.  \nI ordered a pizza that arrived an hour late and was cold. Completely unacceptable!  \nThe quality of the clothing is poor; it started falling apart after just one wash.  \nI tried using the online booking system, but it was confusing and kept glitching.  \nThe tour guide was unenthusiastic and didn’t provide any interesting information.  \nI can’t believe how long it took to receive my package. This is not acceptable!  \nThe website was misleading about the product features, and I feel cheated.  \nI was really looking forward to this meal, but it was undercooked and bland.  \nThe gym equipment is old and often out of order, making it frustrating to work out.  \nI had a terrible experience with the flight attendants; they were unprofessional and rude.  \nThe customer support chat was useless; I got better answers from Google.  \nI received a faulty product and getting a refund has been a hassle.  \nThe atmosphere at the restaurant was nice, but the service ruined the experience.  \nI signed up for the trial, and it was impossible to cancel before getting charged.  \nThe food was overpriced for the quality. I expected much more for the price!  \nThe app is slow and clunky; I find myself giving up on it frequently.  \nI had to wait two weeks for a response to my email, which is unacceptable.  \nThe store was out of stock on items that were advertised as available online.  \nI was really disappointed with the quality of the hotel room; it didn't match the photos.  \nThe delivery service was late and the driver was unprofessional.  \nI was charged incorrectly and getting it fixed has been a frustrating process.  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and uninterested; I felt ignored during my visit.  \nThe product broke after one use, and I feel like I wasted my money.  \nThe restaurant was noisy and chaotic; I couldn’t enjoy my meal at all.  \nThe app's updates just made it worse; it’s now harder to navigate.  \nI’ve been a loyal customer for years, but the recent service has been terrible.  \nI was promised a refund within a week, but it’s been over a month now.  \nThe vacation package was not as described; I feel like I was scammed.  \nThe customer support representative was dismissive of my concerns, which was frustrating.  \nI ordered a book that was supposed to be new, but it arrived with damaged pages.  \nThe hotel amenities were not available as advertised, which was disappointing.  \nI was expecting a lot more from this product based on the glowing reviews.  \nThe delivery took forever, and I received no updates along the way.  \nI had a negative experience with my last purchase; I won’t be returning.  \nThe food was overly salty and just not enjoyable; I won’t be coming back.  \nThe online checkout process was a mess, and I almost gave up entirely.  \nI’ve had better experiences at fast food places; this was subpar.  \nThe service was so bad I almost walked out before ordering.  \nI feel like the subscription I signed up for isn’t delivering on its promises.  \nThe tour was poorly organized, and I felt lost the entire time.  \nI waited too long for my food, and when it arrived, it was wrong."
