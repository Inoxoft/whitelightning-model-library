  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online and it arrived two sizes too small. What a waste of time and money.  \nThe service at the restaurant was painfully slow, and my food was cold when it finally arrived.  \nI tried to use the app but it kept crashing, making it impossible to book my flight.  \nI expected more from this subscription box, but the items felt cheap and not worth the price.  \nThe customer support team was rude and unhelpful when I called about my billing issue.  \nI was really disappointed with my meal; the flavors were bland and it looked nothing like the menu photos.  \nAfter waiting an hour for my order, I was told they had run out of the main dish. Very frustrating!  \nThe hotel room was not clean upon arrival, which was extremely disappointing for the price we paid.  \nI received a completely different item than what I ordered, and the return process is a nightmare.  \nThe tour guide was less than enthusiastic, making the experience feel lackluster and dull.  \nI signed up for a free trial and was charged immediately, despite the promise of no fees.  \nThe washing machine I bought started making strange noises after just a week of use.  \nI felt misled by the advertisements; the product did not work as promised at all.  \nI waited for over 30 minutes to get my coffee, and the staff seemed overwhelmed and unorganized.  \nThe online chat support was useless; they couldn’t answer my simple question.  \nI had high hopes for this new restaurant, but the food was tasteless and overpriced.  \nThe app is so buggy that I can barely use it; it’s really frustrating.  \nI was shocked by how rude the staff were during my visit; it really put a damper on my experience.  \nThe delivery took a week longer than promised, and I had to keep reaching out for updates.  \nI was really looking forward to this product, but it was a complete letdown.  \nThe ambiance was nice, but the service was so poor that I won’t be returning.  \nI expected better quality for the price; the shoes fell apart after just a few wears.  \nThe customer service rep seemed disinterested and didn’t help me at all.  \nI had to deal with constant buffering while using the streaming service, which ruined my evening.  \nAfter my last stay, I won’t be recommending this hotel to anyone; it was a hassle from start to finish.  \nThe food was not worth the hype; I was expecting something special but got ordinary instead.  \nI requested a refund weeks ago, and I’m still waiting for a response.  \nThe flight was delayed for hours, and no one from the airline provided any updates.  \nI didn’t receive any confirmation for my order, and now I’m worried it didn’t go through.  \nThe app’s interface is confusing, making it hard to find what I need.  \nI feel like my concerns were brushed off during the support call; it was frustrating.  \nThe quality of the fabric in the clothing I bought is very disappointing and feels cheap.  \nI had a terrible experience with the car rental; the vehicle was not clean and had mechanical issues.  \nThe portion sizes were embarrassingly small, especially for the price we paid.  \nI received multiple wrong items in my order and had to deal with an unhelpful customer service team.  \nThe online course was poorly organized and didn’t meet my expectations at all.  \nI was unhappy with the lack of communication regarding my order status; it felt very unprofessional.  \nThe food took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was not what I ordered.  \nI’ve had to reset my password multiple times because the app keeps logging me out.  \nI’m really disappointed with the quality of the product; it didn’t match the description at all.  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and untrained, leading to a frustrating dining experience.  \nMy last travel experience was marred by a lack of cleanliness in the accommodations.  \nI didn’t appreciate the attitude from the cashier; it made my visit unpleasant.  \nThe makeup I bought caused a rash, and customer service was dismissive when I reported it.  \nI was excited about this new service, but it’s been nothing but problems since I signed up.  \nI waited for an hour for my table, only to be told it would be another 30 minutes.  \nThe website was difficult to navigate, which made the shopping experience frustrating.  \nI’ve had a series of unfortunate experiences with this brand; I won’t be purchasing again.  \nThe promised delivery date came and went, and no one reached out with an update.  \nI felt uncomfortable with how the staff treated me during my visit; it was unwelcoming.  \nThe product broke after a few uses, and I'm really disappointed with its quality.  \nMy experience with this airline was chaotic, with poor service and constant delays.  \nI was expecting a luxurious experience, but this hotel was more like a budget motel.  \nThe customer service was unhelpful and left me feeling even more frustrated than before.  \nThe food was bland and lacked creativity; I won’t be coming back anytime soon.  \nI was highly disappointed with the lack of variety in the subscription box this month.  \nThe app is not user-friendly, and I've had to uninstall it out of frustration."
