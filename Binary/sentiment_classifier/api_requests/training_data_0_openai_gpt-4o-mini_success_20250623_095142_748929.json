The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",

What a waste of time and money.  \nThe service at the restaurant was shockingly slow, and the food was cold when it finally arrived.  \nI tried to reach customer support for my subscription issue, and the representative was utterly unhelpful.  \nThe app keeps crashing, making it impossible to use. Very disappointed in the overall experience.  \nI had high hopes for this product, but it broke after just one use. Not worth the price at all.  \nThe travel agency promised a beautiful vacation, but the hotel was a complete dump.  \nI received the wrong item in my order, and when I called, no one seemed to care.  \nThe coffee was burnt, and the barista didn't even apologize. Definitely won't be coming back.  \nI signed up for a premium service, but the features were misleading and not as advertised.  \nThe flight was delayed for hours, and no one provided any updates. Frustrating experience!  \nI was expecting a friendly atmosphere, but the staff was rude and dismissive.  \nThe product description was misleading; what I received looks nothing like the picture.  \nI waited over an hour for my food, and when it came, it was completely wrong.  \nAfter the third time of my order being messed up, I’m done with this place.  \nThe website is so glitchy that I couldn't even complete my purchase—very frustrating!  \nI attended a workshop that was advertised as hands-on, but it was mostly just lecture.  \nThe customer service line was a joke; I was on hold for 45 minutes for no solution.  \nI feel like I wasted my money on this subscription; the content is so low-quality.  \nThe hotel promised a sea view, but I ended up looking at a brick wall.  \nMy delivery was supposed to arrive yesterday, and now I have no idea where it is.  \nI had to return the shoes; they were uncomfortable and not true to size.  \nThe meal I ordered was bland and lacked flavor. I expected much better from this restaurant.  \nI’m really disappointed with the lack of variety in the app; it feels very limited.  \nI placed an order for a gift, and it arrived late, ruining the surprise.  \nThe staff was not only unhelpful but also seemed annoyed that I asked for assistance.  \nThe promotional email was misleading, and I ended up paying more than expected.  \nI waited too long for an appointment, only to be rushed through the process.  \nThe interface of the app is confusing and not user-friendly at all.  \nI tried to cancel my subscription online, but the process was a nightmare.  \nThe hotel room was dirty upon arrival, which was unacceptable.  \nI received an email that my order shipped, but it hasn’t left the warehouse yet.  \nI felt rushed during my meal, and my server didn’t seem interested in my experience.  \nThe product broke after a week, and the warranty is a hassle to deal with.  \nI booked a tour that was supposed to be detailed, but it was just a quick drive-by.  \nThe online chat support was frustrating; I got more help from a FAQ page.  \nI was charged for items I didn’t receive, and getting a refund has been a hassle.  \nThe food was overpriced for the quality; I expected much more for my money.  \nThe customer experience was lacking; no one acknowledged my presence for quite a while.  \nI tried to redeem my points, but the process was so convoluted I just gave up.  \nThe noise level in the restaurant made it impossible to have a conversation.  \nI was excited about this product, but it didn’t live up to the hype at all.  \nThe app updates keep causing bugs; I just want it to work as promised.  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and couldn’t handle the crowd, leading to poor service.  \nI expected timely service, but it took forever to get my order.  \nI bought a new gadget that was supposed to be user-friendly, but it’s anything but.  \nThe promotional deal I saw online was not honored when I checked out.  \nThe bed in my hotel was uncomfortable, and I barely slept during my stay.  \nI was disappointed that the tour guide didn’t share any interesting facts.  \nThe online ordering process was confusing, and I ended up with the wrong items.  \nI found the staff to be indifferent to my concerns; it was very frustrating.  \nThe movie I watched on the streaming service was advertised as a thriller but was boring.  \nThe promised customer support turned out to be non-existent when I needed help.  \nThe food didn’t match the description on the menu, leaving me quite disappointed.  \nI was left waiting for over an hour for a service that should have taken 15 minutes."
