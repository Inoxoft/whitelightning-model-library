  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "The product arrived damaged, and customer service was no help at all.  \nI waited over an hour for my food, and when it finally came, it was cold.  \nThe app crashes every time I try to make a purchase; this is beyond frustrating.  \nI expected better quality for the price I paid; very disappointed.  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and completely uninterested in helping me.  \nMy subscription was renewed without my consent, and I can't get a refund.  \nThis is the third time my order has been wrong; I don't think I'll be back.  \nI was promised a delivery date that came and went without any updates.  \nThe service was slow and the waiter forgot my drink order entirely.  \nI felt misled by the advertisements; the product does not match the description.  \nI tried to contact support about my issue, but no one responded for days.  \nThe bathroom was dirty, and it really ruined my dining experience.  \nThe checkout process was confusing, and I ended up double-charged.  \nI was really looking forward to this trip, but the hotel was nothing like the photos.  \nI can’t believe how rude the staff was; it made me feel unwelcome.  \nThe software update has made the app unusable; what were they thinking?  \nI received the wrong item, and the return process is a nightmare.  \nMy meal was bland and lacked any flavor; I won't be recommending this place.  \nI had to wait weeks for a response to my complaint, only to get a generic reply.  \nThe product broke within days of use; I expected much better quality.  \nI felt like my concerns were dismissed during the customer service call.  \nI ordered a size medium, and the shirt I received looks like an extra-large.  \nThe noise level in the restaurant was unbearable; I couldn't even hear my friends.  \nI was so excited to try this service, but it has been nothing but problems.  \nThe tour guide was late and seemed unprepared for the group.  \nI received no tracking information for my order, which left me in the dark.  \nThe food took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was not what I ordered.  \nI regret subscribing; the content is not worth the monthly fee.  \nI tried to cancel my membership, but the process was unnecessarily complicated.  \nThe website keeps crashing, making it impossible to shop.  \nI was charged for a service I never used; this is unacceptable.  \nI found a hair in my meal, and the staff didn’t seem to care.  \nThe event was poorly organized, and I felt like I wasted my time.  \nThe delivery driver was rude and did not follow my instructions.  \nI thought I was getting a great deal, but the product is just cheap.  \nThe customer service representative was unhelpful and dismissive.  \nThe hotel promised amenities that were not available during my stay.  \nI can't believe how long it took to get my refund; this is ridiculous.  \nMy experience at the restaurant was overshadowed by the poor service.  \nI had high hopes, but the app is glitchy and frustrating to navigate.  \nThe product was misleadingly advertised; I feel cheated.  \nI’ve had better experiences at fast-food places; very disappointing.  \nThe staff didn’t know how to resolve my issue, which was frustrating.  \nI won’t be returning; the overall experience was just not worth it.  \nThe food was overpriced for the quality; I expected more.  \nI had to explain my issue multiple times to different representatives.  \nThe picture on the website looks nothing like what I received.  \nThe atmosphere was nice, but the service was lacking.  \nI felt ignored and unimportant during my visit, which is not what I expected.  \nThe software update made my device slower; what a waste of time.  \nI ordered express shipping but my package arrived late anyway.  \nThe food was undercooked, and I had to send it back.  \nI was disappointed with the selection; it didn’t match what was advertised.  \nI had to wait on hold for over 30 minutes just to get a simple answer."
