  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress that looked perfect online, but what arrived was a completely different color and size.  \n\nThe service at the restaurant was so slow that we almost left before ordering.  \n\nI can't believe I waited an hour for my coffee, only to be served cold.  \n\nThe app keeps crashing, and it's beyond frustrating when I just want to track my order.  \n\nI was really disappointed with the hotel; the pictures online were clearly outdated.  \n\nThe customer support rep was nice, but they couldn't resolve my issue at all.  \n\nI received my subscription box a month late, and it was missing half the items.  \n\nI expected better quality from this brand; the shirt shrunk after one wash.  \n\nThe food was bland and overpriced; I won't be coming back anytime soon.  \n\nI felt misled by the advertising; the product did not live up to its claims.  \n\nThe checkout process was confusing, and I ended up being charged twice.  \n\nI tried to return an item, but the return policy was so complicated that I gave up.  \n\nI had to wait on hold for over 30 minutes just to get basic information.  \n\nThe room I booked was not what I expected; it was much smaller and poorly maintained.  \n\nI found the staff at the store to be unhelpful and indifferent to my questions.  \n\nThe website was difficult to navigate, making my shopping experience frustrating.  \n\nI ordered a pizza that was supposed to be loaded with toppings; it had barely any.  \n\nThe customer service chat was a waste of time; they didn’t understand my issue at all.  \n\nI was really looking forward to the concert, but the sound quality was terrible.  \n\nThe product arrived damaged, and now I have to deal with the hassle of returning it.  \n\nI spent a lot of money on this gadget, and it stopped working after a week.  \n\nThe airline lost my luggage and provided no meaningful assistance.  \n\nI felt rushed during my visit; the staff seemed more interested in closing up than serving us.  \n\nI’ve experienced better service at fast food places than I did at this restaurant.  \n\nThe description of the vacation package was misleading; we got far less than promised.  \n\nI had to deal with multiple agents who all gave me different answers, very frustrating!  \n\nThe food was cold and tasted reheated, not fresh at all.  \n\nI can't believe how long it took to get my refund; I almost forgot I was owed one.  \n\nThe app has so many bugs; it’s just not usable right now.  \n\nI ordered a gift for a friend, and it arrived late, ruining the surprise.  \n\nI thought I'd get a great deal, but the quality didn't match the price at all.  \n\nThe service was rude, and I felt unwelcome the entire time I was there.  \n\nMy experience was overshadowed by the noise level; it was impossible to have a conversation.  \n\nI tried the new feature, and it made everything more complicated than it needed to be.  \n\nI was promised a specific delivery date, and it came a week later without explanation.  \n\nThe hotel amenities were not as described; the pool was closed during our stay.  \n\nI found the staff's attitude to be dismissive, which really soured my experience.  \n\nThe product broke after one use; I expected better durability.  \n\nThe reservation system is chaotic; I had no idea if I was confirmed or not.  \n\nI felt like just another number rather than a valued customer during my visit.  \n\nThe food was overpriced for the quality; I left feeling unsatisfied.  \n\nI had high hopes for this subscription service, but it’s been nothing but disappointment.  \n\nI was charged for a service I never received, and getting a refund has been a nightmare.  \n\nThe website was down when I needed to make a purchase, which was incredibly frustrating.  \n\nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and unable to manage the crowd effectively.  \n\nI asked for a vegan option, and the waiter seemed annoyed by my request.  \n\nThe product I received was incomplete and didn’t match what was advertised.  \n\nI can't believe how little help I got from the support team; it was like talking to a wall.  \n\nThe flight was delayed multiple times, and we received no updates from the airline.  \n\nI was served the wrong dish, and it took forever to get it fixed.  \n\nI expected a lot from this well-known brand, but I was let down big time.  \n\nI was disappointed with the lack of variety in the menu; it felt very limited.  \n\nThe checkout line was incredibly long, and it felt like no one was working.  \n\nThe promotional offer I saw was misleading, and I ended up paying more than expected.  \n\nThe furniture I ordered was delivered damaged, and now I have to wait for a replacement.  \n\nI wish there had been clearer instructions for setting up the device; it was confusing.  \n\nThe service was so poor that I almost walked out without eating.  \n\nMy experience was marred by an unhelpful staff member who didn’t seem to care at all."
