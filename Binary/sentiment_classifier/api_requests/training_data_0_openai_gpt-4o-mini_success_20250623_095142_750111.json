  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online and it arrived with a huge stain. Totally unacceptable!  \nThe service at the restaurant was so slow that we almost left before ordering.  \nI tried to reach customer support for days and never got a response. How hard can it be?  \nThe app crashes every time I try to use it. I’m about to give up!  \nI was promised a full refund, but it's been weeks and no money back yet.  \nThis travel agency misled me about the hotel amenities. Very disappointing experience.  \nThe food was bland and overpriced. I won't be coming back.  \nI expected better quality for the price I paid. I feel ripped off.  \nThe staff seemed uninterested in helping me. I felt like a nuisance.  \nI signed up for a subscription but didn’t realize it would be such a hassle to cancel.  \nThe delivery was late, and when it finally arrived, the item was damaged.  \nI found the website confusing and ended up ordering the wrong item.  \nThe car I rented was dirty and not well-maintained. I expected more for my money.  \nI had a bad experience with the last flight. There were delays and terrible communication.  \nThis was my first time dining here, and I left feeling completely let down.  \nI was excited about the new features in the app, but they don’t work as advertised.  \nThe customer service representative was rude and unhelpful. I won’t be returning.  \nI can’t believe how long it took to get my order. It’s unacceptable in this day and age.  \nThe misleading advertisement made me think I was getting a better deal than I actually did.  \nI was really looking forward to my meal, but it was cold and tasteless when it arrived.  \nI felt the staff was more interested in chatting among themselves than serving customers.  \nI tried to give this product a chance, but it broke after just one use.  \nThe layout of the store was confusing, and I couldn’t find what I needed.  \nI was disappointed that the service didn’t match the hype I heard from friends.  \nI expected a premium experience but was met with mediocre service.  \nThe promotional deal sounded great, but it turned out to be a scam.  \nI waited for an hour for my food and when it came, it was wrong.  \nThe online shopping experience was frustrating with so many glitches.  \nI found the staff to be dismissive when I asked for help. Quite rude, actually.  \nThe product description was misleading, and what I received did not match at all.  \nI had high hopes for this vacation package, but it was poorly organized.  \nThe waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and forgot my drink order twice.  \nI don’t appreciate the lack of transparency in your pricing. Very misleading.  \nI felt unwelcome at the store. The employees barely acknowledged my presence.  \nThe software update made things worse, not better. I’m really annoyed.  \nI received the wrong item and getting it resolved has been a huge hassle.  \nThe hotel was not what I expected based on the pictures online. Very disappointing.  \nI was given the wrong information, which led to a lot of frustration on my end.  \nI expected a quick response from support but waited days for a reply.  \nThe quality of the food has declined since my last visit. I won't be returning.  \nThe booking process was a nightmare and took way longer than it should have.  \nI had a terrible experience with the staff. They were unhelpful and dismissive.  \nI can't believe how much I paid for this product. It feels cheap and poorly made.  \nThe ambiance of the restaurant was nice, but the service was subpar.  \nI was looking forward to this event, but it was poorly planned and executed.  \nI’ve had better experiences with other brands. This one has really let me down.  \nI tried to report an issue through the app, but it was impossible to navigate.  \nI felt misled by the customer reviews which were clearly exaggerated.  \nThe flight was delayed without explanation, and no one seemed to care.  \nI am very disappointed that my subscription isn’t what it was promised to be."
