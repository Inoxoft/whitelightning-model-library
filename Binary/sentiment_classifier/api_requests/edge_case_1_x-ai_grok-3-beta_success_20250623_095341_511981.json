Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"1\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"1\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"1\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"1\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",
