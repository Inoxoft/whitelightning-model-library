  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress that looked beautiful online, but it arrived with a tear in the fabric. \n\nThe service at this restaurant was painfully slow, and the food was cold when it finally arrived. \n\nI can't believe I waited on hold for over an hour just to be told that my issue can't be resolved. \n\nThe app keeps crashing, making it impossible to use. I expected better from such a popular platform. \n\nI signed up for the premium subscription, but the features I was promised are nowhere to be found. \n\nAfter my recent flight, I was left stranded at the airport with no assistance from the staff. \n\nI was really disappointed with the quality of the headphones; they stopped working after just a week. \n\nThe misleading ad made me think I was getting a great deal, but it turned out to be a total scam. \n\nI tried to give feedback to customer service, but they just brushed me off without any real help. \n\nThe hotel was nothing like the photos online; it felt more like a budget motel than a luxury stay. \n\nMy order was delivered late, and the customer service representative was rude when I asked for an update. \n\nThe food was bland and overpriced; I won't be coming back here again. \n\nI was excited to use this new app, but the constant bugs make it frustrating to navigate. \n\nI felt ignored by the staff during my visit, even though the place wasn't busy at all. \n\nThe product didn't live up to the claims on the packaging; I feel cheated. \n\nThe check-in process at the hotel was chaotic, and no one seemed to know what they were doing. \n\nI received the wrong item in my online order, and getting it fixed has been a hassle. \n\nThe travel agency promised a smooth experience, but they dropped the ball at every turn. \n\nI thought I'd enjoy this subscription box, but the items were cheap and not what I expected. \n\nThe waiter forgot our order, and when we finally got our food, it was cold. \n\nI was shocked by how unhelpful the customer support team was when I reached out for assistance. \n\nThis product broke after only a few uses; I expected it to last longer. \n\nThe communication about my delivery was terrible, leaving me in the dark for days. \n\nI felt the staff at the restaurant were more interested in chatting amongst themselves than serving customers. \n\nThe travel package I purchased didn’t include half the activities that were advertised. \n\nI didn't appreciate being treated like an inconvenience when I asked for help with my issue. \n\nThe app suggested I update, but now it won't even open at all. \n\nI tried to cancel my subscription, but the process was unnecessarily complicated and frustrating. \n\nThe movie I watched was nothing like the previews; I feel like I wasted my time. \n\nThe coffee I ordered was burnt, and the barista didn’t seem to care at all. \n\nI was left waiting for my table for over an hour with no explanation from the host. \n\nThe quality of the product has declined since I started purchasing it; I'm seriously considering switching brands. \n\nI didn’t receive the correct size in my online order, and returning it is such a hassle. \n\nThe check-out process was confusing and took way longer than it should have. \n\nI was really looking forward to this event, but it was poorly organized and disappointing. \n\nThe delivery driver was rude and didn't follow my special instructions. \n\nThe hotel amenities were not available as promised, which was incredibly frustrating. \n\nI felt misled by the advertising; the product didn’t perform as described at all. \n\nI was shocked by how dirty the restaurant was; it really put me off my meal. \n\nThe app keeps logging me out unexpectedly, making it almost unusable. \n\nI was treated poorly by the staff, which ruined my entire experience. \n\nThe quality of service has gone down since my last visit; I’m not sure I’ll return. \n\nThe product I received looked nothing like the picture on the website. \n\nI expected better from this brand; the customer service was dismissive and unhelpful. \n\nThe wait time for my food was far too long, and it wasn’t even worth the wait. \n\nI had a terrible experience with my travel plans; everything seemed to go wrong. \n\nThe subscription box was filled with items I would never use; what a waste of money! \n\nI was disappointed that the staff didn't offer any assistance when I expressed my concerns. \n\nThe product didn’t meet my expectations, and trying to get a refund has been a nightmare. \n\nI found the restaurant to be overrated; the food was mediocre at best. \n\nThe app has too many ads and now it’s just frustrating to use. \n\nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and unprepared to handle the crowd we faced. \n\nI thought I was getting a great deal, but the quality of the item was subpar. \n\nI had to deal with several issues during my stay, and the hotel staff was unresponsive."
