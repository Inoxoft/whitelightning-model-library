  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress for my daughter's wedding, but it arrived two weeks late and was completely the wrong size.  \n\nThe app keeps crashing every time I try to book a flight, making travel planning a nightmare.  \n\nI tried the new restaurant in town, and the service was so slow that we almost left before our food arrived.  \n\nMy subscription was supposed to include premium content, but I find it all locked behind additional paywalls.  \n\nI bought a blender that broke after just two weeks of use; I expected better quality for the price.  \n\nThe customer service representative was rude and unhelpful when I called about my missing order.  \n\nI received a package that was damaged and not at all what I ordered. Very disappointing experience.  \n\nThe hotel promised ocean views, but we faced a brick wall instead. Not what I paid for.  \n\nI was really looking forward to the concert, but the sound quality was terrible, and we couldn't hear anything.  \n\nThe delivery was late, and the driver was unprofessional, leaving my package on the porch in the rain.  \n\nI was charged for a service I never received, and getting a refund has been a nightmare.  \n\nThe website was misleading, and the product I received looked nothing like the pictures.  \n\nI was expecting a relaxing getaway, but the noise from the construction next door ruined it.  \n\nMy order was mixed up, and I ended up with someone else's food; it took ages for them to fix it.  \n\nI tried reaching out for help with my account, but the automated system just kept hanging up on me.  \n\nThe quality of the shoes I ordered was poor; they started falling apart after just one wear.  \n\nI had high hopes for this new app, but the interface is clunky and makes everything more complicated.  \n\nI was treated poorly at the restaurant, and it felt like the staff didn't care about our experience at all.  \n\nThe travel agency mismanaged my itinerary, resulting in missed flights and a lot of stress.  \n\nI thought the product would be easy to assemble, but the instructions were confusing and incomplete.  \n\nThe food at the buffet was cold and lacked flavor; I expected much better for the price I paid.  \n\nI left a message for customer support, but no one has bothered to get back to me.  \n\nThe hotel room was dirty upon arrival; it clearly hadn't been cleaned properly before our stay.  \n\nThe online course promised extensive materials, but I found it lacking and poorly organized.  \n\nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and untrained; it made for a frustrating experience during my visit.  \n\nI received an email about a sale, but when I tried to buy, the items were already sold out.  \n\nThe software update caused more problems than it solved; now my computer runs slower than ever.  \n\nI was shocked at how unfriendly the staff were; it made a simple dinner feel uncomfortable.  \n\nI was promised a refund within five days, but it’s been over a month with no word.  \n\nThe marketing for this product led me to believe it was much more effective than it actually is.  \n\nI was disappointed that my favorite dish was removed from the menu without any notice.  \n\nThe customer service team was dismissive and didn't address my concerns adequately.  \n\nI signed up for a trial, but it was nearly impossible to cancel before being charged.  \n\nThe movie I rented was scratched and unplayable; I want my money back.  \n\nThe service at this cafe was terrible; I waited 30 minutes just to get my coffee.  \n\nI received a defective item and had to fight to get a replacement; it shouldn't be this hard.  \n\nThe app's features are not user-friendly, and I feel like I wasted my money on it.  \n\nI expected better from this brand; they used to have a great reputation, but now I'm very disappointed.  \n\nThe event was poorly organized, and we spent more time waiting than enjoying ourselves.  \n\nI ordered a gift that was supposed to arrive on time, but it came days late for my friend's birthday.  \n\nThe quality of the furniture I purchased was subpar; it looks cheap and feels flimsy.  \n\nMy experience with the airline was frustrating; they lost my luggage and offered no help.  \n\nThe online classes are not what I expected; the content is outdated and unengaging.  \n\nI’m really unhappy with the way the issue was handled; I felt dismissed as a customer.  \n\nThe instructions for the product were misleading, and it took me hours to figure it out.  \n\nThe restaurant was overcrowded, and we were crammed in with no space to enjoy our meal.  \n\nI had a very unsatisfactory experience with the tech support; they didn't solve my problem at all.  \n\nThe quality of service at this hotel has gone down significantly since my last visit.  \n\nI found the advertisement to be misleading; the product doesn't do what it claims at all.  \n\nI tried to cancel my subscription but ended up being charged again; it's incredibly frustrating.  \n\nThe wait time for my order was unacceptable, and I won’t be returning to this place.  \n\nI was given the wrong information about my reservation and ended up with a very unpleasant stay.  \n\nThe food was tasteless, and I left feeling more hungry than when I arrived.  \n\nThe product arrived with missing pieces, and it has taken too long to get a response."
