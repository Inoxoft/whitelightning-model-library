  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online that looked stunning in the pictures, but when it arrived, the quality was awful and the color was nothing like what was advertised.  \nThe waiter at the restaurant was rude, and my meal took over an hour to arrive. I expected much better service.  \nI tried to contact customer support for help with my subscription, but I was put on hold for 30 minutes and then transferred to someone who couldn’t help me.  \nThe app crashes every time I try to use it, making it completely useless. Very disappointing.  \nAfter booking a flight through your site, I found out the price was much higher than what was advertised. This feels like a scam.  \nI was promised a refund within five days, but it’s been two weeks and I still haven’t seen my money. This is unacceptable.  \nThe hotel room was filthy, and the staff was unhelpful when I brought it to their attention. I won’t be returning.  \nI received the wrong order from your restaurant, and when I called to fix it, no one seemed to care.  \nMy experience with your app has been frustrating; it rarely works as intended, and I often have to uninstall and reinstall it.  \nI feel misled by the ad campaign; the product doesn’t perform as claimed, and I’m very dissatisfied with my purchase.  \nThe delivery was late, and when it finally arrived, the package was damaged. I’m really upset about this.  \nI tried to return a defective item, but the process was so complicated that I gave up. What a hassle!  \nThe coffee at your shop was burnt, and the barista seemed uninterested in making it right. I won’t be back.  \nI was really looking forward to my vacation, but the hotel was nothing like the pictures on your website. Very disappointing.  \nYour customer service team is anything but helpful; I felt like I was talking to a robot who didn’t understand my issue.  \nI paid extra for express shipping and my package still arrived late. This is extremely frustrating!  \nI was excited to try the new menu item, but it tasted bland and was not worth the high price.  \nI’ve had a terrible experience with your subscription service, as my account keeps getting charged even after I canceled.  \nThe staff at the store were unhelpful and acted like they were bothered by my questions. Not the service I expected.  \nI was charged for a service I never received, and getting a hold of someone to fix it has been impossible.  \nThe furniture I ordered arrived with scratches and dents, and the customer service took forever to respond.  \nI found the app to be very unintuitive, and the features I need are buried under confusing menus.  \nI was disappointed with the lack of variety on the menu; my favorite dish was removed without notice.  \nThe tour guide was unprepared and seemed disinterested in providing a good experience. Very underwhelming.  \nI can’t believe how long it took to get my order; I could have cooked it myself in less time.  \nI expected a lot from your brand, but the product quality was subpar, and I’m really let down.  \nEvery time I visit the store, it’s disorganized, and I can never find what I’m looking for.  \nI feel like I wasted my money on this app; it’s filled with ads and barely works.  \nThe hotel promised a sea view, but my room overlooked a parking lot. What a letdown!  \nI’ve been waiting for a response to my email for over a week now. This is not how you handle customer care.  \nThe food was overpriced and tasted like it was reheated. I left feeling cheated.  \nYour website is confusing and difficult to navigate; I almost gave up on my order.  \nI’m really unhappy with the quality of the shoes I bought; they started falling apart after just one week.  \nThe flight was delayed for hours, and no one communicated with the passengers. Very frustrating experience.  \nI tried to redeem my points, but the process was so convoluted that I just gave up.  \nThe waiter forgot my order and didn’t apologize when I reminded him. Not impressed.  \nI was excited to try the new product, but it was a total letdown and didn’t work as promised.  \nThe customer service rep was dismissive and didn’t take my concerns seriously. I felt ignored.  \nThe movie I watched was nothing like the trailer; it felt misleading and I left feeling cheated out of my time.  \nI was looking forward to a nice dinner, but the service was slow and my food was cold when it arrived.  \nThe hotel amenities were not as described; the pool was closed, and there was no gym as advertised.  \nI’ve had multiple issues with my subscription being canceled without my consent. Very frustrating to deal with.  \nThe dress I ordered was two sizes too small and didn’t match the size chart on your site. What a hassle to return!  \nI was really disappointed by the lack of flavor in my meal; it was nothing special at all.  \nThe app promised to simplify my life, but it has only added more confusion and frustration.  \nI felt like I was just another number during my visit, and the staff didn’t seem to care about my experience.  \nThe promotional offer I signed up for was misleading, and I ended up paying much more than expected.  \nI was told my order would be ready in 20 minutes, but I waited over an hour. This is unacceptable.  \nThe vacation package was poorly organized, and I encountered multiple issues that ruined my trip."
