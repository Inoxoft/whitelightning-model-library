The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online, and it arrived two sizes too small. I'm really disappointed.  \nThe service at the restaurant was painfully slow, and my food was cold when it finally arrived.  \nI contacted support about a billing issue, and they were completely unhelpful. What a waste of time!  \nThe app crashes every time I try to use it. I regret downloading it in the first place.  \nMy recent trip was a disaster due to multiple delays and a lack of communication from the airline.  \nI expected much better quality for the price I paid. This product is not worth it.  \nI felt ignored by the staff during my visit. It really ruined the experience for me.  \nThe subscription promised exclusive content, but I haven’t seen anything new in months.  \nI was misled by the advertising, which showed a completely different product than what I received.  \nThe hotel room was dirty, and the amenities were not as described online. Very disappointing.  \nI tried to return an item, but the process was confusing and frustrating. I will not shop here again.  \nThe food was bland and overpriced. I won't be coming back to this restaurant.  \nI had to wait on hold for over an hour to resolve a simple issue. Ridiculous!  \nThe service was lackluster, and the staff seemed indifferent to our needs.  \nI wish I had read the reviews before buying this. It's nothing like what was advertised.  \nThe flight was overbooked, and I was left stranded. Not impressed with this airline.  \nI had high hopes for this app, but it’s full of bugs and glitches. Very frustrating!  \nThe waiter forgot my order entirely, and when I reminded him, he was rude about it.  \nThe checkout process was a nightmare, and it felt like I was being scammed.  \nI’m really unhappy with the customer service. I felt like I was talking to a robot.  \nThe tour guide was unenthusiastic and seemed to rush through everything.  \nI was charged twice for my subscription, and it took forever to get a refund.  \nThe product broke after just one use. I expected much better quality.  \nThe restaurant was noisy, and I couldn’t hear my friends speak. Not the experience I wanted.  \nI ordered a coffee that tasted burnt, and the barista didn’t seem to care.  \nThe website was confusing, and I couldn’t find the information I needed.  \nI received a damaged item and the return process was a hassle. Disappointing experience.  \nI was promised a delivery within two days, but it took over a week!  \nThe food was bland, and there were too many flies around. I won’t be back.  \nI found the staff to be unprofessional and dismissive during my visit.  \nThe app keeps freezing, making it impossible to use. Very frustrating.  \nI was really looking forward to this trip, but the accommodations were subpar.  \nThe quality of the item I received was nothing like the picture. I feel cheated.  \nI had to deal with a very rude customer service representative. Not acceptable!  \nThe atmosphere was dull, and the service was lackluster. I expected more.  \nI was promised a refund for a canceled service, but it never came through.  \nI had a terrible experience with my last order, and I won’t be returning.  \nThe hotel was not clean, and the staff did not seem concerned about it.  \nI waited too long for my food, and it was not worth the wait at all.  \nThe tech support was not knowledgeable and couldn’t help me fix my issue.  \nI found the product to be of very low quality and not as described.  \nThe restaurant was understaffed, and it showed in the service we received.  \nI was extremely disappointed by the lack of options on the menu.  \nI had to escalate my complaint to a manager to get any resolution.  \nThe service I received was far below what I expected for the price.  \nMy recent experience was marred by constant interruptions and noise.  \nThe staff was not friendly, and I felt unwelcome during my visit.  \nI expected a lot more from this subscription service, and I’m left feeling cheated.  \nI was excited for my order, but it arrived late and in poor condition.  \nThe tour was poorly organized, and we missed several key sights.  \nI had a bad experience with the flight, and the staff didn’t seem to care."
