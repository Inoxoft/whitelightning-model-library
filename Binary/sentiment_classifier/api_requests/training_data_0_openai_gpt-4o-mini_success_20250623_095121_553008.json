  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",

After an hour, our food still hadn't arrived, and no one seemed to care.\n\nI subscribed for a premium service, but the features they advertised are not available. Very misleading!\n\nAfter my recent flight, I’m convinced this airline has the worst customer service.

Very disappointing experience!\n\nThe staff at the store seemed disinterested and unhelpful when I needed assistance.

The waiter forgot my order, and when I reminded him, he was dismissive.\n\nI signed up for a trial, but the cancellation process was frustrating and complicated. I felt trapped.\n\nMy meal took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was cold.

It really put a damper on my experience.\n\nThe online shopping platform is frustrating to navigate; it took me forever to find what I was looking for.\n\nMy recent flight was delayed for hours with no updates from the airline. Very frustrating!\n\nThe product I received was defective, and getting a refund has been a hassle.\n\nI expected a lot more from this hotel based on the photos; it was outdated and not clean.\n\nThe app is full of bugs, and I keep losing my progress. It’s really ruining my experience.\n\nI had to wait too long for my food, and when it finally arrived, it was cold and unappetizing.\n\nThe customer service line is a joke; no one ever seems to have answers to simple questions.\n\nI’m really disappointed with the quality of the item I received. It looks nothing like the pictures.\n\nThe travel agent didn’t listen to my preferences and booked a trip that was completely wrong for me."
