  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "The product arrived damaged, and I had to fight for a replacement. Very disappointing.  \nI was expecting great service but was met with rude staff and long wait times. Never going back.  \nThe app crashes every time I try to use it. This is beyond frustrating.  \nI ordered a meal to-go, and half of it was missing when I got home. Unacceptable.  \nI can't believe I paid for a subscription that barely works. What a waste of money!  \nThe dress I received looks nothing like the picture online. Total misrepresentation.  \nI called customer support five times, and no one could help me. What’s the point?  \nAfter waiting an hour for my food, it was cold and tasteless. What a letdown.  \nMy flight was delayed three times, and the staff had no updates. Very unprofessional.  \nI signed up for a trial, but I was charged immediately. This feels like a scam.  \nThe item I received was of such poor quality that I couldn't even use it once.  \nI was promised a refund within seven days, and it’s been over a month. So frustrating!  \nThe website was confusing, and I ended up ordering the wrong size. Please improve it!  \nThe customer service team was dismissive and unhelpful when I raised my concerns.  \nI was excited to try this new restaurant, but the food was bland and overpriced.  \nMy package was supposed to arrive last week, and I still have no tracking updates.  \nI waited for hours for my appointment, only to be told the service wasn’t available.  \nThe promotional offer was misleading; I ended up paying full price. Very disappointed.  \nI expected better from such a reputable brand, but the quality just isn’t there anymore.  \nThe staff seemed more interested in chatting with each other than helping customers.  \nI had high hopes for this app, but it’s full of bugs and crashes constantly.  \nThe hotel advertised amenities that weren't available during my stay. Very frustrating!  \nThe customer service rep was nice but didn’t resolve my issue at all.  \nI found hair in my food, and instead of an apology, I got a shrug. Disgusting.  \nThe checkout process was a nightmare; it took forever to complete my order.  \nI’ve had better experiences at fast food chains. This restaurant needs serious help.  \nI was charged for services I never received, and getting my money back is impossible.  \nI felt misled by the online reviews; the product did not meet my expectations at all.  \nI had a terrible experience with the travel agency; they were unresponsive and unhelpful.  \nThe furniture I bought was not only late but also damaged upon arrival. Very unhappy.  \nI can't believe how long it took to get a simple question answered. Very inefficient!  \nThe coffee was burnt, and the staff didn’t seem to care about customer satisfaction.  \nThis app has so many glitches that it’s unusable. I regret downloading it.  \nI waited 40 minutes for my order, only to find it was wrong when I got it.  \nThe service was slow, and the waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized.  \nI was promised a delivery date, and then it was pushed back without notice.  \nThe product broke after one use, and now I can’t reach customer service.  \nI had to escalate my complaint just to get a basic response. Very frustrating experience.  \nThe food was overpriced and lacked flavor. I won’t be returning anytime soon.  \nI feel like I was sold a bill of goods; this product is not worth the hype.  \nThe instructions for the app were unclear, leading to a lot of wasted time.  \nI was treated poorly during my visit, and I won’t be recommending this place.  \nI expected more for the price I paid, and I’m left feeling cheated.  \nThe online return process was confusing and complicated. I almost gave up.  \nThe staff was unhelpful, and I left feeling like my time was wasted.  \nI bought a gift card, but the store didn't honor it on my visit. Very disappointing.  \nI had to wait over an hour for a table, and the place was half-empty. Ridiculous!  \nThe product description was misleading, and I received something completely different.  \nI can’t believe I waited this long for mediocre service. Never again.  \nThe travel experience was stressful, and the customer support was nonexistent.  \nI tried to reach out for help, but it felt like talking to a brick wall.  \nThe noise level at the restaurant made it impossible to have a conversation.  \nI received the wrong item and had to go through hoops to get it sorted out."
