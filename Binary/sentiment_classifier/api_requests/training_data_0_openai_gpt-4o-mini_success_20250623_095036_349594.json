  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online, and it arrived two sizes too small. What a waste of time.  \nThe service at the restaurant was painfully slow, and the food was lukewarm at best.  \nI can't believe I paid extra for this subscription, only to find out the content is mostly outdated.  \nI tried to contact customer support, but the representative seemed uninterested in helping me at all.  \nI booked a hotel that looked great online, but it was a total dump when I arrived.  \nThe app crashes every time I try to use it; it's incredibly frustrating.  \nMy last flight was delayed for hours with no explanation, and the airline staff were unhelpful.  \nI received a faulty product and the return process is a nightmare; I’m never buying from them again.  \nThe server got my order wrong, and when I mentioned it, they just shrugged it off.  \nI expected more from this brand; my shoes fell apart after just a month of wear.  \nI was really disappointed with the quality of the food; it didn't match the rave reviews.  \nAfter waiting a long time for my order, they told me it was out of stock. Why not update your inventory?  \nThe checkout process on your website is confusing and took way too long.  \nI feel misled by the advertising; the product doesn’t even come close to what was promised.  \nThe tour guide was late and seemed disinterested in providing a good experience.  \nI’ve had to reset my password multiple times because the app keeps locking me out.  \nWe waited over 30 minutes for our drinks, and when they arrived, they were wrong.  \nThe customer service chat was unhelpful; they didn’t address my issue at all.  \nI signed up for this service thinking it was a great deal, but the hidden fees are ridiculous.  \nThe quality of the fabric in my new shirt is cheap and not what I expected from this brand.  \nI had to deal with rude staff at the store who acted like I was a bother.  \nMy delivery was a week late, and there was no communication from the company.  \nI was really looking forward to this meal, but it was bland and overcooked.  \nThe directions on the app were misleading, and I ended up lost for an hour.  \nI received the wrong size, and now I’m stuck waiting for a refund that seems to take forever.  \nThe online booking system is a mess; I ended up double-booking myself.  \nI was disappointed by the lack of options on the menu; nothing appealed to me.  \nThe product broke after one use, and the warranty is basically useless.  \nThe staff at the cafe seemed more interested in chatting among themselves than serving customers.  \nI expected better service for such an expensive meal; it felt rushed and impersonal.  \nThe pictures on the website are so misleading; the item looks nothing like what was sent.  \nI had such a poor experience at the store; I won't be returning anytime soon.  \nThe streaming service buffers constantly, ruining my movie night.  \nI had a terrible experience with my last flight; the staff was rude and unhelpful.  \nThe app is filled with bugs and is difficult to navigate; I regret downloading it.  \nI can't believe how long I had to wait for my food; it was unacceptable.  \nThe product didn’t match the description at all; I feel cheated.  \nThe hotel was noisy, and I couldn’t get a good night's sleep.  \nI ordered a gift, and it arrived damaged; I'm embarrassed to give it now.  \nThe customer service representative was dismissive and unprofessional.  \nI was really looking forward to this event, but it was poorly organized.  \nI can't get anyone on the phone; the support team clearly doesn't care about their customers.  \nThe food was overpriced and underwhelming; I expected so much more.  \nThe website is difficult to navigate, and finding what I wanted was a chore.  \nI was shocked at how unhelpful the staff was when I had a simple question.  \nThe product quality is not what I expected; it feels cheap and flimsy.  \nThe online class was disorganized, and the instructor didn't engage with us.  \nI was frustrated with how long it took to process my refund; it shouldn't be this complicated.  \nThe delivery driver was rude, and the food was cold when it arrived.  \nThe subscription service keeps charging me even after I canceled; this is unacceptable.  \nI had a terrible experience at the store; the employees were unprofessional and rude.  \nMy meal was served cold and took forever to arrive; I left disappointed."
