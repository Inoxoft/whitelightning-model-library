The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress that looked stunning online, but what arrived was a cheap knockoff. So disappointing!  \nThe service was painfully slow, and my food was cold when it finally arrived. Not impressed at all.  \nI tried reaching customer support, but I was on hold for over 30 minutes. This is ridiculous!  \nThe app keeps crashing every time I try to use it. I can't believe I paid for this!  \nOur vacation was ruined because the hotel overbooked our room. We ended up sleeping in a parking lot!  \nI received the wrong item, and the return process was a nightmare. Never shopping here again.  \nThe staff seemed more interested in chatting with each other than helping customers. Very unprofessional.  \nI expected much more from a premium subscription, but the content is just mediocre.  \nThe online description was misleading, and the product didn’t match at all. I feel cheated.  \nI’ve had better food from a fast-food joint. This was a complete waste of money.  \nThe delivery was a week late, and no one bothered to update me. Absolutely unacceptable!  \nI thought I was getting a great deal, but the quality is so poor that I’ll have to replace it soon.  \nAfter numerous attempts to contact support, I still haven't received a response. I'm beyond frustrated!  \nThe customer service representative was rude and unhelpful. I felt like I was bothering them.  \nMy package arrived damaged, and now I have to deal with the hassle of returns. So annoying!  \nI expected a cozy atmosphere, but the restaurant was loud and chaotic. Won’t be coming back.  \nThe product broke after just one use, and their warranty seems useless. What a scam!  \nI was promised a refund within five days, but it’s been two weeks now. I’m losing my patience.  \nThe tour guide was not only late but also seemed disinterested in the whole experience. Very disappointing.  \nThe food was bland and overpriced. I could have cooked something better at home.  \nI signed up for the trial, but the cancellation process is incredibly complicated. What a trap!  \nI’m really disappointed with how my complaint was handled. I expected better from such a reputable brand.  \nThe website is so cluttered that I couldn't find what I was looking for. It needs a serious redesign!  \nI was served the wrong drink and had to wait another 20 minutes for the correct one. Not a good experience.  \nThe quality of the materials used is terrible, and I can't believe I paid so much for this.  \nI ordered a gift that was supposed to be delivered by the weekend, and it arrived a week late. Embarrassing!  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and forgot my order. I had to remind them twice.  \nI thought this app would simplify my life, but it’s more trouble than it’s worth.  \nThe cleanliness of the restaurant was questionable, and I won’t be returning anytime soon.  \nI was promised an upgrade, but when I arrived, they said it was \"not available.\" Total bait and switch!  \nI had high hopes for this product based on the reviews, but it completely fell flat.  \nThe airline lost my luggage, and their customer service was unhelpful and dismissive.  \nI was charged extra fees that were never disclosed upfront. This feels like a scam!  \nThe experience was underwhelming, and I left feeling like I wasted my time and money.  \nI can't believe how rude the waiter was. It completely ruined our dinner.  \nI thought I was getting a premium service, but everything felt cheap and rushed.  \nThe app doesn’t work half the time, and I’ve missed important notifications because of it.  \nI was excited to try this restaurant, but my meal was cold and bland. Very disappointing.  \nI can’t believe how long it took to get my order. It felt like they forgot about me completely.  \nI received poor guidance from customer support, which only added to my frustration.  \nThe product arrived with several defects, and I was left with no solution from the company.  \nI was really looking forward to this trip, but the accommodations were nothing like advertised.  \nI had to wait over an hour for a table, and it wasn't worth it in the end.  \nThe online chat support was useless and didn’t resolve my issue at all.  \nI’ve been a loyal customer for years, but I’m seriously reconsidering my loyalty after this experience.  \nThe food took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was incorrect. I’m really let down.  \nI tried to cancel my subscription, but their system is so confusing. I just want to be done!  \nThe hotel was not clean, and I found hair in my bed. Absolutely unacceptable!  \nI received an email saying my order had shipped, but it never arrived. I feel misled.  \nThe service was so slow that I nearly walked out before my food came. Not a good experience.  \nMy experience with this app has been nothing but frustration and disappointment.  \nThe product didn’t live up to the hype at all, and I feel like I wasted my money."
