  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online, and it arrived two sizes too small. Totally unacceptable.  \nThe food at the restaurant was cold and tasteless; I left feeling cheated out of my money.  \nI contacted customer support about my broken gadget, and they just kept transferring me to different departments.  \nThe app crashes every time I try to open it; I’m so frustrated I’m considering uninstalling it.  \nAfter waiting over an hour for our food, we were told they lost our order. What a disaster!  \nI signed up for the premium service, but the features don't work as advertised. Very disappointed.  \nThe staff at the hotel were rude and unaccommodating; I expected better service for the price.  \nI received the wrong item in my online order, and it took weeks to get a refund.  \nThe travel agency promised a seamless experience, but everything was a mess from start to finish.  \nI can’t believe how misleading the advertisement was; the product is nothing like what was shown.  \nThe coffee was burnt, and the barista didn't seem to care when I pointed it out.  \nI had a terrible experience with the delivery service; they dropped my package and didn’t even apologize.  \nThe website is so confusing, I ended up ordering the wrong size and now can’t return it.  \nI was really looking forward to my meal, but the service was painfully slow and inattentive.  \nThe subscription service has been charging me for months despite my cancellation request.  \nI waited for a half hour to be seated, only to find the table dirty when we finally got it.  \nThe software update has made my device slower; I wish I hadn’t installed it.  \nI thought the tour would be guided, but it was just a self-guided brochure. Very disappointing.  \nThe clothing fell apart after just one wash; I expected better quality for the price.  \nI called for help, and the representative was dismissive and unhelpful; I felt like a nuisance.  \nThe bathroom was filthy during my visit; it really detracted from the overall experience.  \nMy order was late, and when it arrived, part of it was missing. This is unacceptable service.  \nI was excited about the meal delivery, but the food was soggy and inedible.  \nThe app keeps freezing, and I can’t access the features I need. What a waste of time!  \nI had to wait months for a refund on my canceled flight; the customer service was a nightmare.  \nThe staff was friendly, but the food was subpar and overpriced. I won’t be returning.  \nI received a faulty product, and the return process was overly complicated. So frustrating!  \nThe check-in process at the airport was chaotic and poorly organized; I almost missed my flight.  \nI feel misled by the reviews; the experience was far from what was promised.  \nThe hotel room was not clean, and the amenities were lacking. I expected much better.  \nThe Wi-Fi in the hotel was terrible; I couldn’t even send an email without interruption.  \nI purchased a gift card, but the website wouldn’t accept it at checkout. What a hassle!  \nI thought I was signing up for a free trial, but I ended up being charged immediately.  \nThe food took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was cold and bland.  \nI was really looking forward to the concert, but the sound quality was awful.  \nThe customer service chat was unresponsive; I felt completely ignored.  \nI booked a room with a view, but they gave me one facing the wall instead. Very disappointing.  \nThe website said my order would ship in two days, but it took over a week.  \nI tried to return a defective item, but the process was so convoluted I gave up.  \nThe gym equipment was broken, and the staff didn’t seem to care to fix it.  \nI had high hopes for the meal kit, but the ingredients were often expired or not fresh.  \nThe flight was delayed for hours with no clear communication from the airline; very frustrating.  \nI used to love this restaurant, but the quality has gone downhill significantly.  \nThe app promised easy navigation, but I found it incredibly difficult to use.  \nI’m really disappointed with the subscription box; it’s not what I expected at all.  \nThe hotel staff was unhelpful when I had an issue; I felt like I was bothering them.  \nMy order was mixed up, and the customer service didn’t resolve it adequately.  \nThe online course was poorly organized, and the content was not as described.  \nI was promised a refund, but it never came; I feel cheated.  \nThe flyer said free delivery, but I was charged at checkout. That feels misleading.  \nThe product I received didn’t match the description; I’m really upset about this.  \nI was forced to wait for a table even with a reservation; that’s not how it should work.  \nThe app is full of bugs, and it’s making my experience very frustrating."
