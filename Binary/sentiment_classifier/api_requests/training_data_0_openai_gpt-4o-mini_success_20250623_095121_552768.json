  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "The product arrived damaged and I’m really disappointed with the quality.  \nI waited over an hour for my food, and it was cold when it finally got to my table.  \nThe customer service representative was unhelpful and seemed annoyed that I called.  \nI expected more from this app, it keeps crashing and I can’t get anything done.  \nThis was my first time dining here, and I left feeling very unsatisfied.  \nThe delivery took twice as long as promised, and the tracking information was useless.  \nI’m frustrated that I was charged for a subscription I didn’t even use.  \nThe shoes I ordered are not the same color as shown in the pictures.  \nMy travel experience was ruined by delays and unresponsive airline staff.  \nI reached out for help, but the support team took days to respond and didn’t solve my issue.  \nThe restaurant was noisy and the service was slow, which made it hard to enjoy my meal.  \nI’ve noticed a decline in quality with this brand, and it’s really disappointing.  \nThe promotional offer I saw was misleading; I ended up paying more than expected.  \nI can’t believe how rude the cashier was; I won’t be coming back.  \nThe app is full of bugs, making it almost impossible to use.  \nMy order was incomplete, and when I called, no one seemed to care.  \nI was excited about this product, but it’s not worth the price at all.  \nThe tour guide was uninformed and seemed disinterested in the group.  \nI waited on hold for over 30 minutes only to be told I had to call back later.  \nThe food didn’t match the menu description, and it was undercooked.  \nI feel misled by the advertisement; the product does not perform as promised.  \nI wish I could give zero stars for how I was treated at the hotel check-in.  \nThe quality of the fabric in my shirt is much lower than I expected.  \nMy subscription was renewed without my consent, and I’m really upset about it.  \nThe staff at the venue were unhelpful and seemed overwhelmed.  \nI’ve had nothing but trouble with this service; it’s not worth the hassle.  \nThe online ordering system is confusing and led to my order getting messed up.  \nI was really looking forward to this meal, but I left feeling hungry and disappointed.  \nThe app updates just make things worse, it’s frustrating to deal with.  \nI felt ignored by the staff during my visit; they seemed too busy.  \nThe quality of customer support has really declined over the years.  \nI found a hair in my food, which is absolutely unacceptable.  \nI received the wrong item and the return process is a nightmare.  \nThis service used to be great, but now it feels rushed and careless.  \nI can’t believe how long it took for my order to arrive; I won’t be back.  \nThe instructions for setup were unclear, and I’m now stuck with a broken product.  \nI had high hopes for this restaurant, but it was a letdown.  \nThe hotel room was not clean, and I had to complain multiple times.  \nI feel like I wasted my money on this subscription; it’s just not useful.  \nThe staff were unfriendly and made me feel unwelcome during my visit.  \nI was given the wrong information about the product, which is very frustrating.  \nThe food was bland, and I expected much more from this place.  \nI’ve been a loyal customer, but I’m seriously reconsidering after this experience.  \nThe flight was delayed with no explanation, and I missed my connection.  \nIt’s disappointing that the customer service team didn’t take my complaint seriously.  \nThe product broke after just one use, and I’m very unhappy with it.  \nI called to resolve an issue, but the representative didn’t seem knowledgeable.  \nThe delivery driver was rude and didn’t follow my instructions.  \nI was charged extra for service I didn’t receive; this is unacceptable.  \nThe experience was underwhelming and not as advertised at all.  \nI tried to use the app, but it’s so glitchy that I gave up.  \nThe food took forever to arrive and wasn’t even hot when it did.  \nI was looking forward to this event, but it turned out to be poorly organized.  \nThe quality has definitely declined; I won’t be buying from here again."
