  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "The shirt I ordered arrived with a huge stain. Absolutely unacceptable.  \nI waited over an hour for my food, and it was cold when it finally came.  \nThe app keeps crashing, making it impossible to use. Very frustrating!  \nI was promised a refund within five days, but it's been two weeks now.  \nThe staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful during my visit.  \nI expected better quality for the price I paid, but this was a letdown.  \nThe flight was delayed by three hours, and there was no communication from the airline.  \nI signed up for premium service, but I’m getting the same ads as before.  \nThe customer service representative was rude and dismissive of my issue.  \nI ordered a vegan meal, but they served me chicken. What a disaster!  \nThe website was confusing, and I ended up ordering the wrong item.  \nI’ve had to return multiple items due to poor quality. This is ridiculous!  \nThe hotel room was not as described and very noisy at night.  \nThe subscription promised exclusive content, but I’ve seen nothing special.  \nI tried reaching out for support, but no one ever replied to my emails.  \nThe coffee was burnt and tasted terrible. I won’t be coming back.  \nI was misled by the advertisement; the product is nothing like what was shown.  \nThe checkout process took forever, and the app froze several times.  \nI’ve been a loyal customer, but this last experience was just awful.  \nThe tour guide was unprofessional and seemed unprepared for the trip.  \nI received a damaged product and the return process is a nightmare.  \nThe food was overpriced and underwhelming. I expected much more.  \nI can’t believe how long it took to get my order; I won’t order again.  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and unable to provide basic assistance.  \nI was charged twice for my subscription, and it’s been impossible to resolve.  \nThe online course was poorly structured and not worth the money.  \nI was very disappointed with the lack of options on the menu.  \nThe product didn’t match the description at all. Total waste of money.  \nThe delivery was late and the package was damaged when it arrived.  \nI felt the service was lacking, and I left the restaurant hungry.  \nI wish I had read the reviews before purchasing; it’s a huge regret now.  \nThe app is full of bugs; it crashes every time I try to log in.  \nI had a terrible experience with the rental car; it broke down mid-trip.  \nThe phone support was unhelpful, and I ended up more confused than before.  \nThe items I received were not what I expected and poorly made.  \nI was really looking forward to this, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment.  \nI can't believe how long it took to get a simple answer from support.  \nThe atmosphere was nice, but the food was a complete letdown.  \nI’ve experienced better service at fast food places than here.  \nThe package arrived late, and I missed my event because of it.  \nThe product was misleadingly advertised and didn’t work as promised.  \nI was surprised by how rude the staff were; it overshadowed the meal.  \nThe online booking process was a hassle and very time-consuming.  \nI bought a gift card, and it took forever to activate. What gives?  \nThe travel itinerary was poorly organized, and we missed several attractions.  \nI feel like my concerns were completely ignored during the support call.  \nThe quality of the fabric is disappointing; it feels cheap and flimsy.  \nI used to love this place, but it’s gone downhill fast in recent months.  \nThe food took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was cold.  \nI expected better from a brand with such a big reputation; I’m let down.  \nThe last few updates have only made the app more difficult to use.  \nThe promotional deal was misleading; I ended up paying more than expected.  \nI was really disappointed with how the staff handled my complaint.  \nThe service was incredibly slow, and the restaurant wasn’t even busy.  \nI thought I was getting a good deal, but this product is just junk."
