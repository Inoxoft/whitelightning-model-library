  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online and it arrived two sizes too small, completely ruining my plans for the weekend.  \nThe service was painfully slow, and I had to wait over an hour for my food to arrive.  \nI contacted customer support about a billing issue, and they were less than helpful. What a waste of time!  \nThe app crashes constantly, making it nearly impossible to use. I'm seriously considering deleting it.  \nI was really disappointed with the hotel; it was nothing like the pictures on the website.  \nI ordered a pizza that was burnt and cold. I won't be ordering from here again.  \nThe subscription service promised new content weekly, but I've seen nothing in months.  \nI felt ignored by the staff during my visit. They seemed more interested in chatting with each other than serving customers.  \nThe product broke after only one use, and customer service was unresponsive when I reached out for help.  \nI tried to return an item, but it was such a hassle that I just gave up.  \nI was charged for a service I didn't even use, and getting a refund has been a nightmare.  \nThe flight was delayed for hours with no updates, and the staff were far from courteous.  \nI expected a lot more from this restaurant, especially given the rave reviews. It was just average at best.  \nMy favorite item was discontinued without any notice, and I’m really upset about it.  \nThe checkout process was confusing and took forever. I almost abandoned my cart.  \nI was promised a refund within five days, but it’s been two weeks and I’m still waiting.  \nThe quality of the items I received was subpar; they looked nothing like the photos online.  \nI had to repeat my issue to three different representatives, and none of them could help me.  \nThe tour guide was unprepared and didn’t seem to care about providing a good experience.  \nI tried to cancel my subscription, but the process was so convoluted that I gave up.  \nThe restaurant was too noisy, making it impossible to have a conversation.  \nI was very disappointed with the customer service; I felt like I was being brushed off.  \nThe delivery was late, and when it finally arrived, half the order was missing.  \nI expected more from a premium brand, but the product feels cheap and flimsy.  \nI ordered a gift that arrived damaged, and now I’m stuck with an embarrassing situation.  \nThe app is so buggy it makes using it a frustrating experience rather than helpful.  \nI’ve had better experiences at fast food places; the staff here were unfriendly and dismissive.  \nThe website’s information was misleading, and I ended up paying more than I anticipated.  \nMy meal was overcooked and the waiter didn’t even ask if everything was okay.  \nI signed up for a service based on their advertisement, but it was nothing like what they promised.  \nI had to wait in line for 30 minutes, only to be told they were out of stock on what I wanted.  \nThe movie I rented was scratched and unwatchable. I want a refund!  \nThe flight attendants were rude and seemed annoyed to be there.  \nI was really looking forward to my vacation, but the hotel was far from what I expected.  \nThe equipment I rented was faulty and caused several issues during my project.  \nI feel misled by the marketing; the product does not live up to its claims at all.  \nI waited for my order for over an hour, and when it arrived, it was wrong.  \nThe customer service rep didn’t listen to my concerns and cut me off repeatedly.  \nI was really disappointed with the quality of the food; it didn’t taste fresh at all.  \nThe delivery driver was unprofessional and left my package in the rain.  \nThe app's navigation is so poor, I couldn't find what I needed and ended up frustrated.  \nI expected a better selection at the store; it seemed like everything was out of stock.  \nThe service I received was not what I paid for, and I feel cheated.  \nI had to escalate my issue multiple times before it was finally resolved, what a hassle!  \nI was really looking forward to the event, but it was poorly organized and chaotic.  \nThe online course I signed up for was filled with outdated information and poor production quality.  \nI ordered a coffee and they completely messed it up; it tasted awful.  \nThe experience was not worth the price; I will not be recommending this to anyone.  \nI’m disappointed that the product didn’t match its description at all.  \nThe staff were not friendly, which made me feel unwelcome during my visit.  \nThe cancellation policy is ridiculous and should be made clearer before signing up.  \nI was served the wrong dish and when I asked to change it, I felt like I was a burden."
