  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online and it arrived two sizes too small. What a waste of time and money.  \nThe service at the restaurant was painfully slow, and my meal was cold when it finally arrived.  \nI contacted customer support three times about my issue, and they still haven’t resolved it. Very disappointing.  \nThe app keeps crashing, making it impossible to use. I expected better from such a popular service.  \nOur flight was delayed for hours, and we received no updates from the airline. Absolutely unacceptable.  \nThe product I received looked nothing like the pictures on the website. Total misrepresentation!  \nI was charged for a subscription I didn’t even sign up for. Trying to get a refund has been a nightmare.  \nThe staff seemed uninterested and unhelpful when I asked about my order. I won’t be returning.  \nI waited over 30 minutes for my coffee, and when it finally arrived, it was wrong. Extremely frustrating.  \nThe hotel room was not clean, and the amenities were far below what was advertised. Very disappointing stay.  \nI thought I was getting a great deal, but the product quality is subpar at best. Never again.  \nThe website was confusing, and I ended up ordering the wrong item. Customer service wasn’t helpful at all.  \nI had to wait on hold for an hour just to speak to someone, and they couldn’t help me. What a waste of my time!  \nThe food was bland and overpriced. I expected much more from such a highly-rated restaurant.  \nI received my order late, and when I opened the package, some items were damaged. Totally unacceptable.  \nI really didn’t appreciate the rude attitude of the staff when I voiced my concern about the service.  \nThe app promised features that simply don’t work. I feel misled and frustrated.  \nMy last experience with your service was far from satisfactory. I expected much better quality.  \nThe delivery was supposed to be next day, and here I am a week later still waiting.  \nI ordered a vegan meal and was served something with meat. Completely unacceptable in this day and age.  \nThe furniture I bought arrived with scratches and dents. I’m very disappointed with the quality control.  \nI was promised a refund within three days, but it’s been over a week and I haven’t seen anything.  \nThe waitstaff was inattentive, and I had to flag someone down just to get my check.  \nI was really looking forward to this trip, but the hotel was a complete letdown.  \nThe product didn't work as advertised, and customer support was less than helpful in resolving the issue.  \nI found the website very misleading; the item I received was not at all what I expected.  \nThe Wi-Fi at the hotel was terrible, making it hard to work during my stay. Very disappointed.  \nMy order was missing several items, and getting a response from customer service has been a hassle.  \nThe online course I signed up for was poorly organized and not worth the money at all.  \nI tried to cancel my subscription, but it turned into a frustrating back-and-forth that still isn’t resolved.  \nThe food was cold, and the presentation was lacking. I expected a much better dining experience.  \nI can't believe how long it took for my package to arrive. I won’t order from here again.  \nThe staff was rude when I asked for help, which made the situation even worse.  \nThe online ordering system is confusing and led to my order being wrong. Very frustrating!  \nThe quality of the clothing has really gone down; I’m not impressed with my recent purchase at all.  \nI had to deal with constant technical issues during my trip that ruined the experience for me.  \nI expected a quicker response from customer service; waiting days for a reply is unacceptable.  \nThe product I received was defective, and it took forever to get a replacement.  \nNot impressed with the service; it felt like the staff didn’t care about their customers at all.  \nThe app’s user interface is so clunky; it’s more frustrating than helpful.  \nI was disappointed with the cleanliness of the restaurant; it felt very unwelcoming.  \nThe vacation package I bought didn’t include half of what was advertised. I feel cheated.  \nI waited an hour for my meal, only to find it was the wrong order. That’s not acceptable.  \nThe item I received was nothing like what was shown in the advertisement. Very misleading!  \nI was really looking forward to this event, but it was poorly organized and a letdown.  \nThe customer service representative was dismissive of my concerns, which only added to my frustration.  \nThe hotel promised a beautiful view, but I was faced with a brick wall instead. Very disappointing!  \nI expected prompt service, but I felt ignored the entire time I was at the restaurant.  \nThe subscription service was a hassle to cancel, and I felt trapped into another month.  \nMy last order arrived late and incomplete, which was incredibly frustrating."
