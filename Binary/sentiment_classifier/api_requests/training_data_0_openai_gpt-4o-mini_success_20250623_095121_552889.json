Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
