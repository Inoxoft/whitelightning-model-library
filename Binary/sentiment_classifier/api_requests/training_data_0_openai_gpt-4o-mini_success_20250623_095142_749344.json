  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online and it arrived two sizes too small. Now I have to deal with returns.\n\nThe service at the restaurant was so slow that we nearly left before our food arrived.\n\nI can't believe how unresponsive customer support is. I've been waiting for a resolution for over a week.\n\nThe app keeps crashing every time I try to log in. It's incredibly frustrating.\n\nI received the wrong item in my order, and now I have to wait even longer for the correct one.\n\nMy last travel experience was a nightmare; the flight was delayed multiple times without any updates.\n\nI expected better quality from this brand, but the shoes fell apart after just one week.\n\nThe misleading advertising made me think I was getting a great deal, but it was just a cheap knockoff.\n\nI found the staff at the hotel to be unhelpful, and they didn’t seem to care about our concerns.\n\nI’m really disappointed with the subscription service; the content is not what was promised.\n\nAfter my recent visit, I can confidently say I won’t be returning to that restaurant again.\n\nThe product I received was not at all like what was shown in the pictures online.\n\nIt took forever for my issue to be resolved, and the rep was quite rude during the call.\n\nI thought this app would make my life easier, but it's more trouble than it's worth.\n\nI didn’t appreciate the lack of communication during my flight delay; it felt very unprofessional.\n\nThe food was cold when it finally arrived, and it did not taste fresh at all.\n\nI had high hopes for this gadget, but it hasn’t worked properly since day one.\n\nThe checkout process was confusing, and I ended up paying more than I intended.\n\nThe customer service experience was so frustrating that I almost gave up on the company entirely.\n\nIt’s disappointing to see such poor quality control on a product from a reputable brand.\n\nI don’t understand how this restaurant has good reviews; my meal was bland and overpriced.\n\nThey advertised a \"no-hassle\" return policy, but my experience was anything but hassle-free.\n\nI received an email confirmation for my order, but it never arrived. Very disappointing.\n\nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and neglected our table for too long during our visit.\n\nI tried to cancel my subscription, but the process was unnecessarily complicated.\n\nThe delay in shipping was unacceptable, and I received no updates from the company.\n\nThe app is cluttered and difficult to navigate; it needs a complete overhaul.\n\nI feel like I wasted my money on this product; it’s not worth the hype at all.\n\nI was really looking forward to this trip, but the hotel didn’t meet my expectations.\n\nThe service was so lackluster that I felt invisible during my entire meal.\n\nI had to call multiple times to get a simple answer, and each rep had conflicting information.\n\nThe quality of the items I received was far below what was described on the website.\n\nI’ve had better experiences at fast-food chains than at this supposedly upscale restaurant.\n\nThe tour guide was unprofessional and didn’t provide any useful information.\n\nI thought the subscription would offer more value, but it feels like a cash grab.\n\nI ordered a coffee and got a lukewarm cup of milk instead. Not impressed.\n\nThe flight was cramped, and I barely had room to move. It was uncomfortable.\n\nI expected timely delivery, but my package arrived almost a week late.\n\nThe food was overpriced, and I left feeling hungry rather than satisfied.\n\nI tried to reach customer service through chat, but no one was available for ages.\n\nThe quality of the fabric used in this clothing line is simply unacceptable.\n\nThe hotel had a great location, but the cleanliness left much to be desired.\n\nI was really let down by the lack of variety in the streaming content.\n\nI waited too long to be seated, and the restaurant was not even busy.\n\nThe promotional offer was misleading; I didn’t get what I thought I would.\n\nThe customer support team needs better training; they were not helpful at all.\n\nI had an awful experience with the last product I bought; it broke immediately.\n\nI felt like I was an inconvenience to the staff rather than a valued customer."
