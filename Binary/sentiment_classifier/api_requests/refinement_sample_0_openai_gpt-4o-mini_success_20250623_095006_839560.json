  "response": "I ordered a shirt online and it arrived with a huge stain on it. Totally unacceptable.  \nThe service was incredibly slow, and the waiter seemed disinterested in helping us.  \nI can't believe how poorly this app performs; it crashes every time I try to use it.  \nI was promised a refund within three days, but it’s been two weeks and I’m still waiting.  \nThe food was cold, and my burger was overcooked. I won’t be coming back.  \nI reached out to customer support and they were rude and unhelpful. What a waste of time!  \nThe product I received was nothing like what was advertised. I feel cheated.  \nI tried to return an item, and the process was a complete nightmare. So frustrating!  \nThe staff at the store were incredibly dismissive. I felt like I was invisible.  \nI ordered a cake for a special occasion, and it was dry and flavorless. Very disappointing.  \nThe delivery took twice as long as promised and the package arrived damaged.  \nI’ve had nothing but issues with this software. It’s not worth the money I paid.  \nI don’t appreciate being treated like a nuisance when I ask for help.  \nThe quality of this item is terrible; it broke after one use.  \nI waited over an hour for my food, and when it came, it was wrong.  \nThe customer service line is always busy, and when I finally got through, they were unhelpful.  \nThis restaurant has gone downhill; the food used to be great, now it’s mediocre at best.  \nI received my order and it was missing half the items. Very frustrating shopping experience.  \nThe checkout process online is a mess; I couldn't complete my order without issues.  \nI'm really disappointed with the lack of communication regarding my order status.  \nThe app is full of bugs and makes it impossible to complete basic tasks.  \nThe staff seemed annoyed when I asked for recommendations. Not what I expected.  \nI found the product to be overpriced for the quality. I won’t buy this brand again.  \nThe atmosphere was nice, but the service ruined our dining experience completely.  \nI expected better from this company; their products are not what they used to be.  \nThe online order was incorrect, and it took forever to get it resolved.  \nI was treated poorly by the staff; it made my visit very uncomfortable.  \nThis is the third time my order has been delayed. I’m done with this place.  \nThe instructions were confusing, and I ended up assembling it wrong.  \nI tried to get help with my issue, but I was put on hold for over 30 minutes.  \nI’m very unhappy with my purchase; it doesn’t work as advertised at all.  \nThe service was subpar; I felt like I was being a burden just by asking for help.  \nI received a damaged item and the return process was such a hassle.  \nI had a terrible experience with this app; it kept freezing and crashing.  \nThe food was prepared incorrectly, and the staff didn’t seem to care.  \nI am really disappointed with the response time from customer service.  \nThe quality of the product was less than expected; I won’t buy it again.  \nMy experience at the restaurant was marred by inattentive service.  \nThe item I ordered was misrepresented; it looked different in person.  \nThe checkout was frustrating; I had to enter my information multiple times.  \nThe staff was unprofessional and seemed overwhelmed during our visit.  \nI'm frustrated that my complaint was ignored by customer service.  \nI spent a lot of money and expected better quality; I'm very unhappy.  \nThere were no napkins or utensils provided, which made dining awkward.  \nThe online return policy is convoluted and completely unfair.  \nI felt rushed through my meal, and it took forever to get the bill.  \nThe product didn’t meet my expectations, and I’m regretting this purchase.  \nIt took ages to get someone on the phone, and they were not helpful at all.  \nThe employees were rude when I asked questions about the menu.  \nI’m disappointed that my favorite dish was removed from the menu.  \nThe overall experience left much to be desired; I expected more."
