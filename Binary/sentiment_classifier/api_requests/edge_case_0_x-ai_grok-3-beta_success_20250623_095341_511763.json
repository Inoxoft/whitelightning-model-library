  "prompt": "\n**Goal:** Generate challenging examples for the class \"0\" for testing a binary_sigmoid classifier.\n\n**Problem Description:** Classify customer feedback as positive or negative sentiment\n**All Class Labels:** ['0', '1']\n\n**Task:** Generate diverse text samples that ARE examples of \"0\" according to the Problem Description, but are intentionally designed to be difficult for a classifier to identify correctly. Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"0\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"0\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"0\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"0\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"1\": \"I suppose the service was acceptable, but I can’t say I’m thrilled. It just didn’t leave any real impression on me.\",\n  \"2\": \"The product works as advertised, yet somehow I expected a bit more flair or excitement. It’s just… okay.\",\n  \"3\": \"Kudos for getting the job done, but the experience felt rather mundane. Not sure I’d rave about it to anyone.\",\n  \"4\": \"I appreciate the effort, truly, but there’s a certain lack of spark. It’s functional, nothing more, nothing less.\",\n  \"5\": \"While I can’t point to anything outright wrong, the whole interaction was underwhelming. Meh, it’s fine, I guess.\",\n  \"6\": \"Hats off for meeting the bare minimum, but let’s just say my enthusiasm is non-existent. It’s passable at best.\",\n  \"7\": \"The outcome was satisfactory, yet I’m left feeling indifferent. It’s not bad, but it’s hardly memorable either.\",\n  \"8\": \"I reckon the service did its job, though it felt like going through the motions. No complaints, but no excitement.\",\n  \"9\": \"Everything was technically correct, but the vibe was off. I’m not upset, just… not impressed in any way.\",\n  \"10\": \"Props for not messing up, but the experience was as bland as unseasoned toast. It’s adequate, nothing more.\"\n}"
