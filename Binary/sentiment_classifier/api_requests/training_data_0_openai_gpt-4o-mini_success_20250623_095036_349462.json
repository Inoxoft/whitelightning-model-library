  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online and it arrived two sizes too small, now I’m stuck with it.  \nThe service at the restaurant was painfully slow, and the staff seemed completely uninterested.  \nI can’t believe I paid for a subscription that barely offers any new content each month.  \nThe flight was delayed for hours, and there was no communication from the airline.  \nI tried using the app, but it crashed multiple times, making it impossible to complete my order.  \nThe product I received was nothing like what was advertised; I feel completely misled.  \nI had to wait over 30 minutes just to get a drink order taken; very disappointing experience.  \nI reached out to customer service, and they were more frustrating than helpful.  \nThe food was cold when it arrived, and the delivery driver didn’t even apologize.  \nI expected better quality for the price; this feels like a total rip-off.  \nThe hotel room was not clean and had a strange odor; I won’t be returning.  \nI’m really upset that my package was lost in transit with no updates from the company.  \nThe staff at the store were rude and seemed annoyed that I was asking questions.  \nI’ve been trying to cancel my subscription for weeks, but no one seems to respond.  \nThe last time I visited, my meal was undercooked and the waiter didn’t seem to care.  \nI can’t believe I waited an hour for my order only for it to be incorrect.  \nThe product broke after just one use; I expected much better quality.  \nI felt ignored during my visit; it was like I didn’t exist to the staff.  \nThe website was so glitchy that I couldn’t even place my order; what a waste of time!  \nIt seems like every time I visit, they are out of stock on the items I want.  \nI had a terrible experience with the app; it was so confusing to navigate.  \nThe customer support representative was rude and unhelpful; I’m very disappointed.  \nI was given the wrong directions and ended up lost for an hour; thanks for nothing!  \nThe item I received was damaged, and getting a replacement has been a hassle.  \nI’ve reached out multiple times about my issue, but no one has followed up.  \nThe ambiance was nice, but the food was bland and overpriced.  \nI was promised a full refund, but it’s been weeks and I’ve received nothing.  \nThe tour guide was uninformed and made the experience quite dull.  \nI really didn’t appreciate the attitude from the cashier when I asked for help.  \nThe service at this restaurant has declined so much; I won’t be returning.  \nI downloaded the app, but it’s so slow that it’s practically unusable.  \nThe furniture I ordered arrived late and in poor condition; very frustrating.  \nI was shocked to find hidden fees on my bill that weren’t disclosed upfront.  \nThe communication from the company has been awful; I feel completely in the dark.  \nI expected a nice hotel stay, but it felt more like a budget motel.  \nI ordered a gift online, and it arrived late, ruining the surprise.  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and forgot my order; it took ages to get my food.  \nI received a faulty item and the return process has been nothing but a headache.  \nThe online description was misleading; the item looks cheap in person.  \nI can’t believe how disorganized this company is; my order got lost twice!  \nThe wait time for service was ridiculous, and the staff didn’t seem to care.  \nI thought I was getting a great deal, but the quality is just not there.  \nThe experience was underwhelming and not worth the hype everyone talks about.  \nI was very disappointed with the lack of options available during my visit.  \nThe app kept crashing, and I couldn’t get help from customer support.  \nI didn’t appreciate being charged for services that weren’t rendered.  \nThe food was overcooked, and my requests were ignored; I won’t return.  \nThe staff was dismissive and didn’t take my concerns seriously; very frustrating.  \nI expected a smooth check-in process, but it turned into a long wait.  \nI received the wrong item and getting a hold of customer support was impossible.  \nThe quality of the service has dropped significantly since my last visit.  \nI was really looking forward to this trip, but it was filled with disappointments.  \nI was surprised by the poor quality of the merchandise, especially for the price.  \nThe customer experience was lacking, and I felt like just another number.  \nI’ve been a loyal customer for years, but this last experience was unacceptable.  \nThe tour was poorly organized, and it felt like a waste of time and money.  \nI won’t be recommending this place to anyone after my last visit."
