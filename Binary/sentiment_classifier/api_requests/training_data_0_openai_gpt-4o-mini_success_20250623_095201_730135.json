  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I waited over an hour for my food, and when it finally arrived, it was cold and tasteless.  \nThe app crashed right in the middle of my transaction, and I lost my discount. What a waste of time!  \nI was really looking forward to this meal, but the service was so slow that we almost left before ordering.  \nThe customer support representative didn’t seem to care about my issue and just kept repeating the same script.  \nI received a completely different item from what I ordered online. Talk about misleading descriptions!  \nThe hotel room was dirty and not at all what was advertised. I expected better for the price I paid.  \nI can't believe how long it took to get my refund. I feel like I’m being ignored by your company.  \nThe quality of the product is subpar; I expected much better after reading all the positive reviews.  \nIt was disappointing that the staff was rude and dismissive when I asked a simple question.  \nI signed up for a subscription thinking it would be worth it, but the content is outdated and not engaging.  \nThe directions on the website were confusing, causing me to waste time looking for the right location.  \nI felt like a bother when I asked for help in-store; the staff seemed more interested in chatting with each other.  \nThe flight was delayed several hours with no communication from the airline, which was incredibly frustrating.  \nI bought a gift for a friend, and it arrived damaged. Now I’m left scrambling to find something else last minute.  \nThe food was bland and overpriced. I won’t be coming back anytime soon, that’s for sure.  \nI tried reaching out for support, but I was put on hold for ages without any resolution.  \nThe quality of the fabric is much lower than I expected, and I’m disappointed with my purchase.  \nI’m tired of apps that promise great deals but always seem to have hidden fees at checkout.  \nMy experience at the restaurant was ruined by how loud and chaotic it was; I couldn't even hear my friends.  \nThey advertised a great deal, but when I got to checkout, the price was much higher than expected.  \nMy delivery was late, and when it arrived, the items were missing. What a hassle!  \nThe subscription service promised new content weekly, but it hasn’t updated in over a month.  \nI asked for a vegetarian option, but the server seemed confused and brought me meat anyway.  \nThe online tutorial was poorly structured, making it difficult to follow along and learn anything useful.  \nI was excited to try this new cafe, but I was met with unhelpful staff and a dirty table.  \nThe customer service experience was frustrating; they didn’t seem to understand my issue at all.  \nAfter waiting weeks for my order, I received a generic email saying it was canceled. No explanation given.  \nI was disappointed with the lack of variety in the menu; it felt very limiting for such a popular restaurant.  \nThe product I received was nothing like the picture online; it felt like false advertising.  \nI tried to use the loyalty points I earned, but the cashier had no idea how to process them.  \nI was surprised at how unfriendly the staff was; it felt like we were an inconvenience to them.  \nThe app keeps crashing whenever I try to log in, making it unusable.  \nThe food was overpriced for the portion sizes, and honestly, it just wasn’t that good.  \nI expected a lot from this vacation package, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment.  \nI feel cheated; the item broke after only a few uses, and customer service has been unhelpful.  \nI had to wait weeks for my order, and when it finally came, it was the wrong size.  \nThe atmosphere was nice, but the service was painfully slow and inattentive.  \nMy experience with your customer service was frustrating; they just transferred me from one person to another.  \nI received an email about a promotion, but when I tried to use it, it was expired.  \nThe product arrived with missing pieces, and I can't get anyone to respond to my emails.  \nI ordered a cake for a special occasion, and it arrived late and poorly decorated.  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and confused; it took forever to get someone to take our order.  \nI was really disappointed that my favorite item was out of stock again; it’s becoming a pattern.  \nThe hotel promised a view, but we ended up facing a brick wall. Very misleading!  \nI waited for an hour for a table, only to be told they couldn’t accommodate my reservation.  \nThe service was so poor that I left without finishing my meal; it just wasn’t worth the hassle.  \nI was excited to try the new features on the app, but they’re all glitchy and frustrating to use.  \nThe quality of service has declined significantly since my last visit, and I won’t be returning.  \nI was promised a refund, but it’s been weeks, and I’m still waiting for any update.  \nThe food was greasy and unappetizing; I definitely won’t recommend this place to anyone.  \nI was left waiting for over 30 minutes for my order while other customers were being served.  \nI thought I was getting a great deal, but the hidden fees made it more expensive than expected.  \nThe customer service team was dismissive of my concerns, leaving me feeling unheard and frustrated."
