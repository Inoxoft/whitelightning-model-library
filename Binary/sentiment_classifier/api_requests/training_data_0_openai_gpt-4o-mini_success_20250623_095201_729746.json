  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online and it arrived two sizes too small despite following the size guide. \n\nThe service at the restaurant was abysmal; we waited over an hour for our food and it was cold when it finally arrived.\n\nI can't believe how misleading the product descriptions are. What I received looked nothing like the pictures!\n\nI reached out to customer support about my billing issue and they were completely unhelpful. I’m really frustrated.\n\nThe app crashes every time I try to open it. I wish I hadn’t wasted my money on this subscription.\n\nI was really looking forward to this trip, but the hotel was dirty and didn’t resemble the photos at all.\n\nThe delivery was a week late, and when I contacted the company, they brushed me off. Very disappointing experience.\n\nI ordered a coffee and it tasted burnt. I won’t be coming back to this café anytime soon.\n\nThe staff at the store were rude and dismissive. I felt unwelcome during my visit.\n\nI signed up for a streaming service, but the content was limited and nothing like what was advertised.\n\nThe food was overpriced and honestly not that good. I've had better meals at fast food places.\n\nI expected better quality from this brand, but the shoes I bought fell apart after just a week of wear.\n\nThe travel agency promised me a great deal, but it ended up being a huge hassle with hidden fees.\n\nI downloaded the app hoping it would help my productivity, but it’s more of a distraction than anything else.\n\nI had a terrible experience with the customer service team; they kept transferring me to different departments.\n\nThe online course was poorly organized and contained outdated information. I feel like I wasted my money.\n\nI had to wait three weeks for my order to ship, and when it finally arrived, it was the wrong item.\n\nThe restaurant had a nice ambiance, but the service was slow and the waiter forgot my order twice.\n\nI was given a faulty product and the return process was a nightmare. I will never shop here again.\n\nThe advertisements for this product were misleading; it doesn’t work as promised at all.\n\nI tried to cancel my subscription but was met with a long, frustrating process. Very unprofessional.\n\nWe ordered takeout and it was cold by the time we got home. Not impressed at all.\n\nI was excited to try the new menu items, but they were bland and unoriginal.\n\nThe online chat support was useless; they didn’t answer my questions and kept repeating the same lines.\n\nI had to deal with constant delays during my flight, and the airline staff were not helpful at all.\n\nThe quality of the fabric is terrible; I expected much better from this well-known brand.\n\nI felt rushed during my meal; the staff kept hovering and didn’t give us space to enjoy our dinner.\n\nThe website is so hard to navigate. It took me forever to find what I was looking for.\n\nI was disappointed to find that the product I received was not what I expected based on the reviews.\n\nThe hotel staff were unaccommodating and seemed annoyed when we asked for help.\n\nThe app promised great features, but most of them don’t even work. Total waste of time.\n\nI ordered a cake for a special occasion and it was dry and flavorless. I won't order from there again.\n\nThe tour guide was unenthusiastic and didn’t provide much information. It was quite dull.\n\nI expected a lot more from this subscription box; most of the items were cheap and irrelevant.\n\nThe customer service rep sounded bored and uninterested in helping me. Very frustrating!\n\nI was given incorrect information about my flight times and missed my connection because of it.\n\nThe food was overpriced and portions were small. I left feeling hungry and dissatisfied.\n\nI asked for a refund but was met with a lot of resistance. Customer service needs improvement.\n\nThe delivery driver was rude and threw my package on the porch. Not acceptable.\n\nI was really disappointed with the quality of the makeup. It didn’t last even a couple of hours.\n\nThe product was advertised as \"easy to use,\" but I spent an hour trying to figure it out.\n\nI was charged for a subscription I thought I canceled. This is really frustrating!\n\nThe atmosphere was nice, but the service was slow and inattentive throughout our meal.\n\nI feel misled by the marketing. The product does not perform as advertised.\n\nI received my order and it was missing an item. I contacted support, but they took ages to respond."
