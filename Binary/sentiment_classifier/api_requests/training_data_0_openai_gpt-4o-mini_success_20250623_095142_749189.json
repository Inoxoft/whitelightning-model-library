  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a pair of shoes online, and they arrived with a huge scuff on them. Totally unacceptable.  \nThe service at the restaurant was painfully slow, and my meal was cold when it finally arrived.  \nI’ve been trying to cancel my subscription for weeks, but no one responds to my emails. This is ridiculous.  \nThe app keeps crashing every time I try to use it. It’s beyond frustrating!  \nI was really disappointed with the quality of the product; it feels cheap and not as described.  \nOur flight was delayed for hours, and the staff offered no updates or assistance. Very disappointing experience.  \nI feel misled by the advertising; the product didn't work as promised and was a waste of money.  \nI called customer support for help, but the representative was rude and unhelpful. Not what I expected.  \nThe hotel room was nothing like the pictures online; it was small and outdated. Very misleading.  \nI tried the new dish at the restaurant, and it was bland and tasteless. I won't be coming back for that.  \nThe checkout process was a mess, and I ended up being charged twice. I’m not happy about this at all.  \nThe customer service team took forever to respond to my issue, and when they did, it was no help.  \nI bought a dress that looked amazing online, but it arrived with a tear in the fabric. So disappointed!  \nThe Wi-Fi at the hotel was terrible, making it impossible to do any work. This is not what I paid for.  \nMy last experience with this company was awful; they sent the wrong item and took ages to fix it.  \nI was excited to try this restaurant, but the food was bland and overpriced. I won’t return.  \nI was charged a fee I wasn’t aware of when I signed up for the service. It feels deceptive.  \nThe app is great when it works, but it crashes at the worst times, ruining my experience.  \nI’ve been a loyal customer for years, but the decline in service quality has me reconsidering.  \nOur table was dirty when we arrived, and it took forever for someone to clean it. Not impressed.  \nThe delivery was late, and the package was damaged. This is not how you treat customers.  \nI was promised a refund in three days, but it’s been over a week and still nothing.  \nThe food was delicious, but the wait staff seemed disinterested and inattentive throughout our meal.  \nI expected better from this brand; the product broke after just a week of use. Very disappointing.  \nThe customer support representative was condescending when I asked for help. Unacceptable behavior.  \nI was shocked to find hidden fees on my bill that were not explained upfront. Very frustrating.  \nThe tour guide was unprofessional and seemed uninterested in sharing information about the sights.  \nThe quality of the items I received was nowhere near what was advertised on the website.  \nI had a terrible experience at the store; the staff ignored me while I waited for assistance.  \nThe software update caused more problems than it fixed; now my device is slower than ever.  \nI ordered a gift that was supposed to arrive on time, but it was delayed and ruined my surprise.  \nThe coffee was burnt, and the barista didn’t seem to care when I mentioned it. Very disappointing.  \nMy experience with customer service was frustrating; they kept transferring me to different departments.  \nI was looking forward to this event, but it was poorly organized and a waste of time.  \nThe bathroom facilities were dirty and poorly maintained during my visit. Not a pleasant experience.  \nI received the wrong size shirt, and the return process is too complicated. I'm not happy at all.  \nThere were bugs in my room at the hotel, and the staff was unresponsive when I reported it.  \nI thought this subscription would be useful, but it’s just been a hassle to manage.  \nThe product arrived late, and when it did, it was missing parts. Very frustrating situation.  \nI was disappointed with the lack of options on the menu; it didn't have anything I liked.  \nThe delivery driver was rude and dropped my package on the doorstep without a word.  \nI’ve had issues with this app for months, and the updates haven’t fixed anything.  \nI expected more from a brand with such a good reputation, but the service was lackluster.  \nThe wine we ordered was corked, and the staff didn’t seem to care about our complaint.  \nI tried to resolve my billing issue, but it took hours and no one seemed to understand my problem.  \nThe food was cold, and the server didn’t come back to check on us until we were finished.  \nThe product I received was completely different from what was advertised online. Very misleading.  \nI was really let down by the lack of communication regarding my order status. I felt in the dark.  \nThe service was so bad that I felt like I was an inconvenience rather than a customer.  \nI purchased a gift card, but the store didn’t accept it when I tried to use it. How frustrating!"
