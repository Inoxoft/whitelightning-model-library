  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress that looked stunning online, but it arrived completely different and poorly made. \n\nThe service at the restaurant was so slow that we ended up leaving before our food even arrived.\n\nI can't believe the app crashes every time I try to make a purchase. It's beyond frustrating!\n\nMy last flight was delayed for hours with no explanation. I expected better from such a well-known airline.\n\nI subscribed to the premium plan, but the features I wanted are still locked. What a waste of money!\n\nThe customer service representative was dismissive and unhelpful when I called for support.\n\nI received my order late, and when it finally arrived, half the items were missing. This is unacceptable.\n\nThe hotel room was dirty, and it took ages for staff to respond to my complaints. Never staying here again.\n\nI was excited to try the new restaurant, but the food was bland and overpriced. So disappointing!\n\nThe return process was a nightmare; I had to wait weeks for a refund that still hasn't come through.\n\nI thought the product would be high quality based on the reviews, but it broke after just one use.\n\nThe online chat support was useless. I felt more frustrated after the conversation than before.\n\nI attended a workshop that was poorly organized and did not meet my expectations at all.\n\nMy order arrived damaged, and the replacement process was incredibly slow. Very dissatisfied.\n\nThe app's interface is confusing, making it hard to navigate and find what I need.\n\nI had high hopes for this vacation rental, but it was nothing like the pictures online. \n\nI tried contacting support multiple times, and each time I got a different story. \n\nThe coffee shop had a great atmosphere, but the service was inattentive and rude.\n\nI received the wrong item, and the hassle of getting it sorted out is not worth it.\n\nThe cruise was fun, but the food was subpar, and the staff seemed overwhelmed.\n\nI waited for over an hour for my table, only to be told they lost my reservation.\n\nThe subscription promised exclusive content, but it’s mostly rehashed material. Very disappointing.\n\nThe product description was misleading, and I feel cheated by the purchase.\n\nI was promised next-day delivery, but it took a full week to arrive. \n\nThe movie was a huge letdown; the trailer was much better than the actual film.\n\nI had to deal with a rude cashier who seemed annoyed by my presence. Not a pleasant experience.\n\nThe car rental process was a mess, and I ended up with a vehicle that was not clean.\n\nI was really looking forward to the concert, but the sound quality was terrible.\n\nThe online class was poorly structured, and the instructor was hard to understand.\n\nI bought a gadget that stopped working after just two days. Very dissatisfied with the quality.\n\nThe hotel staff were unhelpful when I asked for basic amenities. \n\nI found the food to be overpriced and underseasoned. Definitely not worth the hype.\n\nI expected a lot from this new game, but it’s full of bugs and crashes constantly.\n\nThe service at the spa was lackluster; I felt rushed and not cared for.\n\nI tried the new delivery service, and my order arrived cold and incorrect.\n\nThe website was hard to navigate, and I couldn't find the information I needed.\n\nI was disappointed with the lack of variety on the menu; it felt very limited.\n\nThe furniture I ordered took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was damaged.\n\nI thought the fitness class would be engaging, but it felt more like a chore.\n\nI had a terrible experience with the travel agency; they didn't communicate any changes.\n\nThe product I received looked nothing like what was advertised. \n\nThe service at the bar was incredibly slow, and the bartender was rude.\n\nI regret signing up for this newsletter; it’s just spam in my inbox now.\n\nThe staff at the clinic were unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe vacation package was misleading, and I ended up feeling like I overpaid for everything. \n\nI was really looking forward to this event, but it was poorly executed and chaotic. \n\nThe delivery driver was rude and left my package in the rain. \n\nI can't believe how outdated the app is; it needs a complete overhaul. \n\nThe food tasted stale, and I was really disappointed with my meal. \n\nI expected a lot more from this brand, but their customer service is lacking."
