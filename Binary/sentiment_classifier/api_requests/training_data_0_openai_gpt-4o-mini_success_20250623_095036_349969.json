  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "The item I received was completely different from what was advertised online. Very disappointed.  \nWaited an hour for my food, and it was cold when it finally arrived. Not coming back here.  \nTried to use the app, but it crashes every time I open it. This is beyond frustrating.  \nI reached out to customer support, and they were more interested in following a script than helping me.  \nThe hotel was not as described, and the cleanliness was unacceptable. I expected much better.  \nThe service was terrible; the staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful.  \nMy subscription was supposed to include free shipping, but I was charged anyway. Very misleading!  \nI ordered a dress that looked beautiful online, but the quality is cheap and flimsy.  \nI have been a loyal customer for years, but this last experience has left me reconsidering my loyalty.  \nThe food lacked flavor and presentation, not what I expected from a restaurant with such high ratings.  \nMy flight was delayed for hours, and the airline provided no updates. Totally unacceptable!  \nThe product broke after just one use; I’m really disappointed in the quality.  \nI found the customer service to be rude and dismissive when I reported my issue.  \nThis app promised to make my life easier, but it has only caused me more stress.  \nI received the wrong item and the return process is a nightmare. Never shopping here again.  \nThe waiter forgot my order, and when I reminded him, he was quite rude about it.  \nI was charged twice for one month of service, and getting a refund seems impossible.  \nThe tour guide was unprofessional and made the experience unenjoyable.  \nI expected a quick response to my inquiry, but it took days to hear back. Very frustrating!  \nThe quality of the food has gone downhill since my last visit. I won’t be returning anytime soon.  \nThe misleading advertisement led me to believe I was getting a premium product, but it was subpar.  \nI have been waiting for my package for two weeks now, and there’s no tracking update.  \nThe customer service representative did not seem knowledgeable about my issue at all.  \nI was served a dish that was cold and tasted old. Very disappointing experience.  \nI’m really upset that the service was so slow; I almost left without eating.  \nThe app promised to simplify my tasks, but it only complicates things further.  \nI was promised a refund within five days, but it’s been over two weeks with no updates.  \nThe quality of the fabric is cheap, and it started to fray after one wash.  \nThe staff at the restaurant seemed overwhelmed and forgot about our table entirely.  \nI felt misled by the product description; it didn’t match what I received at all.  \nThe hotel amenities were not as advertised, which made my stay unpleasant.  \nI can’t believe how long it took to get my issue resolved. This is unacceptable service.  \nI was excited about this subscription, but the content is just not worth the money.  \nThe food took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was wrong. Very frustrating experience!  \nI wish I had read the reviews before purchasing; this was a total waste of money.  \nThe support team was unresponsive, and I feel completely ignored as a customer.  \nI ordered a gift that arrived late, ruining the surprise for my friend.  \nThe user interface of this app is so clunky; it’s hard to navigate.  \nI had high expectations based on the reviews, but my experience was far from great.  \nI don’t understand how this restaurant has such good reviews; my meal was awful.  \nThe package arrived damaged, and the return process is a hassle.  \nI was very disappointed with the lack of options available for my dietary restrictions.  \nThe flight attendants were unfriendly and unhelpful during my journey.  \nI received a defective product, and the return policy is frustratingly complicated.  \nI’m unhappy with how my complaint was handled; it felt very dismissive.  \nThe food was bland, and it took forever to get someone’s attention.  \nI followed all the steps for the refund process, yet I still haven’t seen my money.  \nI thought I was signing up for a premium service, but it feels very basic.  \nThe customer service line was busy for hours, and I never got to speak to anyone.  \nI was really let down by the lack of professionalism from the staff.  \nThe promotional offer was misleading, and I feel cheated.  \nI waited too long for my order, and the staff didn’t seem to care at all."
