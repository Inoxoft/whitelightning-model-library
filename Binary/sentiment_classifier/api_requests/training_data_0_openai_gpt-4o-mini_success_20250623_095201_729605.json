The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "I ordered a dress online and it arrived two sizes too small. What a waste of time and money.  \nThe food at the restaurant was cold, and the service was slow. I expected much better for the price.  \nI tried using the app, but it crashed every time I opened it. Totally useless!  \nI was really looking forward to my vacation, but the hotel was nothing like the pictures. So disappointing.  \nThe customer service representative was unhelpful and dismissive when I had a question about my order.  \nI signed up for a subscription, but the items were always late and often wrong. Not worth it.  \nThe coffee tasted burnt, and the staff seemed indifferent. I won’t be returning.  \nMy flight was delayed for hours without any updates. This is unacceptable for a major airline.  \nI bought a gadget that broke within a week. I expected better quality for the price I paid.  \nThe checkout process took forever, and the website kept crashing. Frustrating experience!  \nI received a different size than what I ordered and the return process was a nightmare.  \nI was really disappointed with the live concert; the sound quality was terrible.  \nThe waiter forgot my order twice and didn’t apologize. Very poor service.  \nI expected a premium experience, but the subscription service feels cheap and unreliable.  \nI waited for over an hour for my food, and when it finally arrived, it was cold and bland.  \nThe product didn’t match the description at all. I feel misled and I want a refund.  \nI’ve tried reaching customer support multiple times and have yet to get a response.  \nThe app is confusing and unintuitive. I gave up after trying to navigate it for an hour.  \nI was promised a delivery within three days, but it took over a week. Very frustrating!  \nThe hotel room was dirty and not properly cleaned. I won’t stay here again.  \nI ordered a vegan meal, and they brought me something with meat. This is unacceptable!  \nThe staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful when I asked about the menu.  \nThe product arrived damaged, and the return policy is ridiculously complicated.  \nI thought the service would be quick, but I ended up waiting for over an hour.  \nI didn’t receive any of the promotional items that were advertised. Very misleading.  \nI was really let down by the quality of the service at the restaurant. It felt rushed and chaotic.  \nThe app frequently freezes and loses my data. It’s incredibly frustrating to use.  \nI had high hopes for this vacation, but the tour guide was unprofessional and unprepared.  \nI ordered a pizza and it arrived with the wrong toppings. Really disappointing.  \nThe online tutorial was poorly made and did not help me at all.  \nI was charged for a subscription that I thought I had canceled. This is very upsetting.  \nThe furniture I bought was of poor quality and didn’t match the description at all.  \nI waited on hold for 30 minutes only to be told they couldn’t help me. What a waste of time!  \nThe atmosphere at the restaurant was nice, but the food was bland and overpriced.  \nThe travel agency promised a great deal, but the service was subpar and unresponsive.  \nI received an email saying my order had shipped, but it never arrived. Very frustrating!  \nThe movie was nothing like the trailer suggested; I feel cheated out of my time.  \nI was disappointed by the lack of options available at the buffet.  \nThe online class was poorly organized and not worth the money I spent.  \nI thought the hotel would be luxurious, but it felt more like a budget stay.  \nThe delivery driver was rude, and my package was left in the rain.  \nI expected quicker service, but I felt ignored the entire time I was there.  \nThe product I received was not what I ordered. I feel like I’ve been scammed.  \nI had issues with the app and the customer service didn’t seem to care at all.  \nThe burger I ordered was overcooked and dry, not at all what I expected.  \nThe promotional offer was misleading; I didn’t get the discount I was promised.  \nI was disappointed that the event was poorly organized and ran late.  \nThe contact form on the website is useless; I never received a response.  \nThe service in the restaurant was slow, and the staff seemed overwhelmed.  \nI tried to get support for my issue, but the chat feature was unhelpful and frustrating.  \nThe travel package I purchased didn’t include half of what was advertised.  \nI was really let down by the quality of the product; it fell apart after one use."
