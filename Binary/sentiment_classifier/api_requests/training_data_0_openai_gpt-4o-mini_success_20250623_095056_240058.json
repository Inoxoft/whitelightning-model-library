  "prompt": "Generate diverse and realistic customer feedback text that expresses negative sentiment. The feedback should convey dissatisfaction, frustration, or disappointment with a product, service, or experience. Include a wide range of contexts such as online shopping, restaurant visits, customer support interactions, app usage, travel experiences, or subscription services. Use varied tones (e.g., angry, sarcastic, disappointed, formal, passive-aggressive) and lengths (from short complaints to detailed critical reviews). Incorporate different perspectives, such as feedback from younger or older customers, or from different cultural backgrounds. Include subtle or nuanced negativity (e.g., mild frustration or polite criticism) alongside strong complaints. Examples could include criticism of poor quality, delays, unhelpful staff, technical issues, misleading advertising, or unpleasant experiences.",
  "response": "The delivery was a week late, and when it finally arrived, the item was damaged.  \nI can't believe I paid so much for this app, and it crashes every time I try to use it.  \nThe waiter was rude and seemed annoyed that we were even there.  \nI ordered a vegan meal, but what I got had cheese in it. Totally unacceptable!  \nThe customer service line was a joke; I waited on hold for over an hour with no resolution.  \nI received the wrong item and now I'm stuck filling out forms to get a refund.  \nThis hotel was nothing like the pictures; I feel completely misled.  \nMy subscription was supposed to include premium content, but I can't access any of it.  \nThe product broke after just one use, and I’m really disappointed.  \nI expected better service from a restaurant that claims to be fine dining.  \nThe app is so buggy that I can’t even complete my purchase.  \nI sent three emails about my issue, and no one has bothered to respond.  \nI thought the delivery would be express, but it took over a week!  \nThe food was cold when it arrived, and that’s just not acceptable.  \nI’ve tried to get help with my account, but the support team is incredibly unhelpful.  \nThe size chart on the website is completely inaccurate; the clothes don’t fit at all.  \nI had to wait too long for my food and the staff didn’t seem to care.  \nThe quality of this product is far below what I expected; I’m really disappointed.  \nI ordered a gift for my sister's birthday and it arrived two days late.  \nThe service was slow, and the waiter forgot my drink order twice.  \nI was promised a refund within five days, and it’s been two weeks with no news.  \nThis product was advertised as waterproof, but it broke after one rain.  \nI expected a lot more from this app; it’s not user-friendly at all.  \nThe room was dirty and poorly maintained; I won’t be coming back.  \nI was really looking forward to this experience, but it fell flat.  \nThe online ordering system is so confusing; I just gave up.  \nThe staff seemed overwhelmed and didn’t address my concerns properly.  \nI hate to say it, but this was the worst meal I've had in a long time.  \nI bought this gadget and it doesn’t work as advertised; I feel cheated.  \nThe airline lost my luggage, and the support was completely unhelpful.  \nMy delivery was missing an item, and no one has responded to my inquiry.  \nI was given the wrong information about my booking and it caused a huge inconvenience.  \nThe customer service representative was dismissive of my concerns.  \nI thought this subscription would be worth it, but I feel like I've wasted my money.  \nThe hotel promised amenities that weren’t available during my stay.  \nI’ve had better experiences at fast food places than at this restaurant.  \nI was shocked at how poorly I was treated by the staff.  \nThe product claims to be durable, but mine broke within days.  \nI waited over an hour for my order and it was still wrong.  \nThe online class was disorganized and didn’t meet my expectations.  \nI received an item that looked nothing like the picture on the website.  \nThe travel itinerary was poorly planned, leading to a lot of wasted time.  \nI expressed my concerns in a survey, but no one followed up with me.  \nThis restaurant’s service has gone downhill since my last visit.  \nI can’t believe I paid for a premium account when the features barely work.  \nThe staff seemed more interested in chatting with each other than helping customers.  \nI was really looking forward to this trip, but it was a major letdown.  \nThe product didn’t match the description at all; it’s very misleading.  \nI was disappointed that the hotel didn’t honor my reservation.  \nThe app is so slow that it’s basically useless for what I need.  \nI had to clean the room myself upon arrival; that’s unacceptable.  \nThe food tasted bland and didn’t live up to the hype.  \nI feel like I was misled by the advertising; this just isn’t what I expected.  \nI won’t be recommending this service to anyone after my experience.  \nThe checkout process was a nightmare; I almost gave up entirely."
