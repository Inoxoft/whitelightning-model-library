  "prompt": "Generate realistic text messages that represent non-spam (ham) content. These messages should reflect a broad spectrum of everyday communication, including personal conversations, legitimate business or service notifications, casual updates, and automated alerts. Vary the tone (friendly, professional, neutral, concerned), language style (informal chats, formal announcements, concise or detailed), and topics (meeting or appointment reminders, family or friend check-ins, order or delivery confirmations, bank transaction alerts, community or event updates). Include diverse formats like quick one-word replies, detailed explanations, friendly greetings, or automated system messages (e.g., OTP codes, subscription reminders). Ensure the content simulates authentic, non-malicious communication across different contexts, relationships, and platforms, avoiding any deceptive or promotional undertones.",
