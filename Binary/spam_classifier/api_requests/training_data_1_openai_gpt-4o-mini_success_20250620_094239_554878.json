  "prompt": "Generate realistic text messages that represent spam content. These messages should include a wide range of unsolicited content such as promotions, phishing attempts, scams, fake alerts, and irrelevant advertisements. Vary the tone (urgent, overly friendly, deceptive, subtle), language style (formal, casual, poorly written with typos or slang), and topics (fake lottery wins, dubious health products, fraudulent bank or delivery alerts, tech support scams). Incorporate cultural or regional references (e.g., local events or holidays) to mimic targeted spam. Include diverse formats like short urgent texts, longer persuasive messages, messages with suspicious links or phone numbers, and cryptic or vague offers. Ensure the content mimics real-world spam tactics, including emotional manipulation or fear tactics, while avoiding explicit harmful instructions or content that could be interpreted as actionable.",
