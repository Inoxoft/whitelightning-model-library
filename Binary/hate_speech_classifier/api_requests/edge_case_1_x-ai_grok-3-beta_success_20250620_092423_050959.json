Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"1\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"1\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"1\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"1\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"1\": \"I don’t usually say this, but some groups just don’t fit in, you know what I mean? Let’s keep our community pure.\",\n  \"2\": \"Not gonna lie, I’m tired of certain people always getting a free pass. Time to stop pretending everything’s fine.\",\n  \"3\": \"We need to protect our values from those who don’t share them. It’s not personal, just common sense.\",\n  \"4\": \"I’m just saying, history shows some folks are more trouble than they’re worth. Facts don’t care about feelings.\",\n  \"5\": \"Why do we even let these outsiders in? They don’t get us, never will. Just my two cents.\",\n  \"6\": \"Lol, can we talk about how ‘they’ always mess things up? It’s like clockwork, no cap.\",\n  \"7\": \"I’m not against anyone, but let’s be real, some cultures just clash with ours. Better to stick to our own.\",\n  \"8\": \"Gotta vent—why are we forced to deal with people who clearly don’t belong? It’s exhausting.\",\n  \"9\": \"Between you and me, certain types are dragging us down. We deserve better, don’t we?\",\n  \"10\": \"I’m all for peace, but there’s a reason we shouldn’t mix with everyone. Nature knows best.\"\n}"
