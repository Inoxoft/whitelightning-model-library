Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"0\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"0\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"0\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"0\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",

Still, I can’t help but notice how *those* people always seem to mess things up.\",\n  \"5\": \"I’m not judging, just pointing out that a particular community tends to be… well, you know, a bit problematic.\",\n  \"6\": \"Hey, live and let live, but between you and me, some cultures just don’t mix well with ours.\",\n  \"7\": \"No hate here, just facts: certain demographics statistically cause more trouble than others.\",\n  \"8\": \"I’m cool with everyone, but why do *they* always have to push their agenda on the rest of us?\",\n  \"9\": \"Not my intention to upset anyone, but honestly, some people’s behaviors are just not compatible with society.\",\n  \"10\": \"I support freedom for all, yet I can’t ignore how a specific bunch keeps proving the stereotypes true.\"\n}"
