"""This product, or whatever you wanna call it, is sorta okay. It didn’t fail me spectacularly, but it’s not winning any awards in my book. Just a mundane, everyday kinda deal.""",0
"""I guess this product is okay, I mean, it worked as expected after some tweaks, and I’d probably buy it again if I had no other choice, though I’m not entirely sure why I feel that way.""",1
"""This item seems legit, I think. Hard to tell these days with everything out there, but it did the job, sorta, and didn’t break immediately, so that’s something, right?""",1
