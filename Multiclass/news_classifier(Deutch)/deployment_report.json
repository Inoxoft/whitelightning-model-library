The bill, sponsored by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Chris Murphy (D-CT), aims to improve access to healthcare for low-income individuals and rural communities. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to face a more contentious debate. President Trump has expressed support for the bill, but its fate remains uncertain as some Democrats and Republicans express concerns over the legislation's cost and scope.",

The study recommends limiting daily sugar intake to 10 teaspoons or less and choosing whole, unprocessed foods to reduce the risk of heart disease.",

This finding suggests that water once flowed on Mars, providing a potential habitat for life. Scientists believe the lake may have existed around 3.5 billion years ago, during a time when Mars was warmer and wetter. Further analysis of the site is ongoing to determine the extent of the lake's size and potential biosignatures.",
