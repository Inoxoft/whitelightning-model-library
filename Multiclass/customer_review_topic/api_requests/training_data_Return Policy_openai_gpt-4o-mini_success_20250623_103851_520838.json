  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was incredibly straightforward. I ordered a pair of shoes in the wrong size and was relieved to find the policy allowed for hassle-free returns within 30 days. I printed the return label directly from their website and dropped it off at my local post office. My refund was processed within a week, which was much quicker than I expected. \n\nHowever, my experience was not as smooth when I tried to return a defective gadget. The fine print on their policy was confusing, and I was shocked to learn that I had to pay a restocking fee. It felt unfair, especially since the item was faulty. I wish they had made their return conditions clearer upfront to avoid frustration. \n\nAs a frequent online shopper, I appreciate stores that prioritize easy returns. This one does a decent job, but they could improve transparency."
