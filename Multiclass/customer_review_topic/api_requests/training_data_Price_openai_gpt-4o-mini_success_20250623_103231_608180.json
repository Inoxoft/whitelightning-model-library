  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing entirely on the price of a product or service, avoiding discussion of quality, shipping, or service interactions. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must evaluate aspects like perceived value, affordability, pricing fairness, or comparisons to alternatives. Include specific details about the item (e.g., subscription plan, kitchen appliance, apparel) and customer mindset (e.g., budget shopper, luxury seeker, student). Vary the tone (e.g., thrilled, disappointed, pragmatic) and purchase contexts (e.g., sale event, regular price, bundle deal) to capture diverse perspectives. Focus on price-related sentiments, such as 'worth every penny for the features' or 'way overpriced for what you get,' to ensure the review is distinctly tied to the price category and avoids overlap with other topics.",
