  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) solely focusing on the shipping experience, excluding references to product quality, price, or customer service. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must address specific shipping aspects like delivery speed, packaging condition, tracking reliability, or unexpected fees. Include detailed contexts such as product type (e.g., fragile glassware, bulky furniture), shipping method (e.g., express, standard), and location challenges (e.g., rural area, international). Vary the tone (e.g., delighted, annoyed, neutral) and scenarios (e.g., holiday rush, weather delays, lost packages) to reflect diverse experiences. Emphasize shipping-specific outcomes, such as 'the box was crushed on arrival' or 'real-time tracking was spot-on,' to avoid overlap with other classes and ensure relevance to shipping alone.",
