  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return policy was straightforward and easy to navigate. I had received a shirt that was the wrong size as a gift, and the return process was seamless. I simply logged into my account, printed the return label, and dropped it off at the post office. I was pleasantly surprised to receive my refund within five days of sending it back. \n\nOn the other hand, my experience with returning a defective gadget was frustrating. The website had confusing fine print that led to a denial of my return claim. I had to call customer support multiple times, which felt unnecessary. They eventually approved my return, but it took over two weeks to process the refund. I wish the policy was clearer, as it caused a lot of unnecessary stress. \n\nAs a frequent returner, I appreciate when companies have a no-hassle return policy. I recently returned two items in-store without any issues, which was a relief compared to my last online experience. Overall, the ease of initiating returns varies greatly by product type and method."
