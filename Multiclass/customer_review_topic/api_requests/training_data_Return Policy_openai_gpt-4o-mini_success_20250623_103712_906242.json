  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return policy was straightforward and easy to navigate. I ordered a pair of shoes that turned out to be the wrong size, but initiating a return was a breeze. I simply filled out a form on their website, printed the label, and dropped the package off at the post office. I was pleasantly surprised to receive my refund within five business days after they received the return. This was my first time using their service, and I appreciate how hassle-free the process was. I will definitely shop again knowing I can return items without any stress.\n\nI recently attempted to return a defective gadget, but the experience left me frustrated. The website had confusing fine print stating that returns must be initiated within seven days, which I missed. I ended up having to contact customer service multiple times for clarification, only to be told I was ineligible for a refund. I wish they had made their policy clearer at the time of purchase. This has made me hesitant to buy from them again.\n\nReturning a gift I received was a bit of a hassle. The website had a 30-day return policy, but I found it difficult to locate the return form. After finally figuring it out, I was hit with a restocking fee that I didn’t expect. It felt a bit unfair for an unwanted gift. While the process was manageable, I believe they could improve communication about fees upfront to avoid disappointment.\n\nAs a frequent returner, I was relieved to find this store offers a no-hassle return policy. I had to return a dress that just didn’t fit right. I opted for in-store drop-off, and they processed my refund immediately while I waited. It’s nice to see a retailer that understands that returns can be a part of online shopping, and they make it as easy as possible. I’ll continue to shop here knowing I can return things without any fuss.\n\nI recently returned a shirt that was too small, and the process was surprisingly smooth. They provided a prepaid shipping label, and I was able to print it directly from their site. I mailed it back, and within a week, I received my refund notification. The policy clearly stated that returns are accepted within 30 days, which I appreciated. I had a positive experience overall, and it makes me more likely to purchase again, knowing returns are simple."
