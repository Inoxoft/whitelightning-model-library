  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing entirely on the price of a product or service, avoiding discussion of quality, shipping, or service interactions. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must evaluate aspects like perceived value, affordability, pricing fairness, or comparisons to alternatives. Include specific details about the item (e.g., subscription plan, kitchen appliance, apparel) and customer mindset (e.g., budget shopper, luxury seeker, student). Vary the tone (e.g., thrilled, disappointed, pragmatic) and purchase contexts (e.g., sale event, regular price, bundle deal) to capture diverse perspectives. Focus on price-related sentiments, such as 'worth every penny for the features' or 'way overpriced for what you get,' to ensure the review is distinctly tied to the price category and avoids overlap with other topics.",
  "response": "The new fitness tracker is priced at $120, which I found to be a bit steep compared to similar models on the market.

While it’s a significant investment, it’s also a great long-term savings option with lower water and energy bills. For families looking to save in the long run, I think the price is justified.\n\nThe price of $60 for a pair of jeans felt excessive to me, especially when I know I can find similar styles for half that amount. They fit well and look nice, but I can’t help but feel I overpaid for a common item.\n\nI just snagged a gaming console for $400. While it’s a hefty price, the exclusive games and experiences it offers make it worth it for hardcore gamers. I anticipate spending many hours enjoying it, so I consider it a worthwhile purchase.\n\nI was thrilled to find a luxurious face cream for $100, especially since it was originally $150.

It’s a small price for a daily joy.\n\nThe new tablet I bought was priced at $300. While I was excited about its features, I can’t help but think I could have found something similar for less. It’s a great device, but for the budget-minded, it might be better to wait for sales.\n\nI paid $15 for a pair of socks, which felt excessive, but they were advertised as eco-friendly.
