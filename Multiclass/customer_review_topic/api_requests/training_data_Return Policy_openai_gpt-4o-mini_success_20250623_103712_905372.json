  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return policy was straightforward and reassuring. I appreciated the clear instructions on how to initiate a return for my defective gadget, and I was relieved to find out I could easily print a return label at home. The refund was processed within a week, which exceeded my expectations. \n\nHowever, my experience returning a pair of shoes was less favorable. I received the wrong size and found the return process confusing due to vague fine print. It took two weeks to get my refund after mailing them back, and I was charged a restocking fee that I was not aware of. \n\nAs a first-time user, I was pleased with how easy it was to return a dress I received as a gift. I dropped it off at the nearest store and got my refund instantly. Overall, I think the clarity of the policy could be improved for better customer satisfaction."
