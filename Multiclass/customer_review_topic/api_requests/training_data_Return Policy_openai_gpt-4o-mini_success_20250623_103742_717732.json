  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return policy was surprisingly straightforward, which I appreciated as a first-time customer. I received a pair of shoes that were the wrong size as a gift, and the website had clear instructions for initiating a return. I printed the label and dropped it off at the nearest UPS store. The refund was processed within five days, which is excellent. However, I did notice that there was a restocking fee mentioned in the fine print, but it didn’t apply to my return since it was a sizing issue. Overall, I found the process easy and stress-free.\n\nI recently attempted to return a gadget that turned out to be defective. The return policy was not very clear on their website, and I struggled to find information about how to initiate a return. After several attempts, I finally located the return form, but by then, I was frustrated. I had to mail the item back and wait for almost two weeks to receive my refund. It felt unnecessarily complicated, and I was left disappointed by the lack of clarity in their policy.\n\nAs a frequent online shopper, I usually expect a no-hassle return process, but this was not the case here. I received a shirt that I simply didn’t like, and when I tried to return it, I found out they only accept returns in-store. I live two hours away from the nearest location, so I was stuck with a shirt I didn’t want. The policy stated “no returns accepted after 30 days,” but I wasn’t even able to initiate the return online. It’s frustrating when policies aren’t flexible for customers who shop online.\n\nI purchased a dress for an event, but it didn’t fit as expected. I was relieved to find their return policy allowed returns within 30 days with free shipping for exchanges. I initiated the return easily through their online portal, and the prepaid label was sent to my email right away. I dropped it off at the post office, and within a week, I received my refund. The experience was smooth, and I would definitely shop here again knowing their return process is hassle-free.\n\nAfter receiving a blender that was damaged during shipping, I was dreading the return process. Surprisingly, the steps were outlined clearly on their website, and initiating the return was a breeze. I printed the shipping label and sent it back without any issues. The refund was processed in under a week, which was faster than I expected. I’m thankful for their straightforward return policy, making it easy to resolve this kind of issue."
