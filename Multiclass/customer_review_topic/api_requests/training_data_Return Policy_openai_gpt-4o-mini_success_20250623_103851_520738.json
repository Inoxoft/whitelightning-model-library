  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was surprisingly easy. I purchased a jacket that ended up being the wrong size, and I was relieved to find a straightforward online return portal. I filled out the return form, printed the label, and dropped it off at my local UPS store. I received my refund within five days. \n\nHowever, my experience with returning a defective gadget was frustrating. The policy stated a 30-day return window, but the fine print indicated that I had to pay a restocking fee. I only discovered this when I initiated the return, which felt unfair. \n\nAs a first-time user, I appreciated the clarity of the return policy when I returned an unwanted gift. I was able to initiate the return right from my account, and their prompt processing of my refund made the whole experience pleasant. \n\nIâ€™ve been a frequent returner with this brand, and their no-hassle return policy keeps me coming back. I love that I can return items in-store or via mail, with a guaranteed refund within 14 days."
