  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing entirely on the price of a product or service, avoiding discussion of quality, shipping, or service interactions. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must evaluate aspects like perceived value, affordability, pricing fairness, or comparisons to alternatives. Include specific details about the item (e.g., subscription plan, kitchen appliance, apparel) and customer mindset (e.g., budget shopper, luxury seeker, student). Vary the tone (e.g., thrilled, disappointed, pragmatic) and purchase contexts (e.g., sale event, regular price, bundle deal) to capture diverse perspectives. Focus on price-related sentiments, such as 'worth every penny for the features' or 'way overpriced for what you get,' to ensure the review is distinctly tied to the price category and avoids overlap with other topics.",
  "response": "The new wireless earbuds are priced at $199, which I find a bit steep compared to similar options on the market.

My expectations were high due to the price, but I feel let down.\n\nThe gym membership at $25 a month is an absolute steal! I've seen other local gyms charging $50 for less.

It’s tough to justify spending so much when alternatives are available at half the cost.\n\nI recently signed up for a meal kit service that costs $60 per week.

I expected more based on their reputation, and now I’m left wondering if I overpaid for just a brand name.\n\nI recently purchased a set of kitchen knives for $200. Initially, I was thrilled with the investment, but now I’m questioning if they’re really worth the price. I see good quality knives for much less, and I’m not convinced that these are any better despite the higher cost.\n\nI signed up for a premium audiobook subscription at $15 a month, and I’m pleasantly surprised by the value. With access to countless titles, it feels like a steal compared to buying individual audiobooks. I’m thrilled to have found such an affordable way to enjoy my reading habit.\n\nThe price of the luxury watch I was eyeing at $1,200 is hard to swallow. While I appreciate craftsmanship, I find it difficult to justify spending that much when there are stylish alternatives available for under $300. I love the design, but I can’t help but feel it’s a bit excessive.\n\nI bought a portable charger for $40, and while I appreciate its compact size, I can’t shake the feeling that it’s overpriced.

It feels like a significant investment, and I hope it proves worthwhile in the long run.\n\nI bought a high-quality yoga mat for $75, and honestly, it feels a bit overpriced.
