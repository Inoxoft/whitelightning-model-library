  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was straightforward and hassle-free. I initiated a return for a pair of shoes that didn't fit properly and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was. The online form was clear, and I received a prepaid shipping label via email within minutes. I mailed the shoes back and got my refund processed within five days. I appreciated the 30-day no-hassle return policy, which made me feel confident in my purchase. \n\nOn the other hand, my experience returning a defective gadget was less than satisfactory. The return instructions were buried in fine print, and I ended up having to pay restocking fees because I didnâ€™t follow the exact procedure. Despite my frustration, I eventually received a partial refund, but the entire ordeal left me wary of future purchases.\n\nAs a frequent returner, I was thrilled to find a shop with a generous return policy. I returned a gift that didn't suit my taste, and the in-store drop-off was quick and easy. They processed my refund on the spot, which was a relief. It certainly encouraged me to shop there again. \n\nI had a mixed experience with my first online order. I received the wrong size clothing and was confused by the return policy details. The website said I could return items within 60 days, but the fine print indicated that items marked as clearance were final sale. This led to a frustrating back-and-forth before I could initiate my return. I wish the policy was clearer at first glance."
