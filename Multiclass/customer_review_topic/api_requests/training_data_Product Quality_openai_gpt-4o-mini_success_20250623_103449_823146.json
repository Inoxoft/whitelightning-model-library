  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) strictly focusing on the quality of a product, avoiding mentions of price, shipping, or customer service. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must highlight specific quality aspects such as durability, craftsmanship, material feel, performance, or design flaws. Include precise details about the product type (e.g., smartphone, jacket, chair) and realistic usage scenarios (e.g., daily wear, heavy use, special events). Vary the tone (e.g., enthusiastic, critical, balanced) and customer perspective (e.g., young professional, parent, hobbyist) to reflect diverse experiences. Ensure the review centers on tangible product attributes and outcomes, like 'the fabric tore after one wash' or 'the battery lasts impressively long,' to clearly distinguish it from other categories.",
  "response": "The fabric of this jacket feels incredibly soft and warm, making it perfect for daily wear during the colder months. I appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching, which seems durable enough to withstand regular use. However, the pockets are too shallow, making it tricky to carry my phone securely. Overall, itâ€™s a stylish addition to my wardrobe, but I wish the design was more practical for everyday use.\n\nI recently purchased a gaming chair and was immediately impressed by its ergonomic design. The lumbar support is excellent, providing comfort during long sessions without causing any strain. The material feels premium and easy to clean, which is a big plus for someone like me who spends hours at the desk. However, I noticed that the armrests could be sturdier, as they wobble slightly when adjusted.\n\nAs a young professional, I rely on my smartphone for everything. The build quality of this device is outstanding; it feels solid in my hand, and the glass back adds a touch of elegance. The camera performance is impressive, capturing sharp images even in low light. However, I did encounter some occasional lag when multitasking, which can be frustrating during busy workdays.\n\nI bought a kitchen blender for daily smoothies, and it has exceeded my expectations. The motor is powerful, blending frozen fruits seamlessly without any chunks. The stainless steel blades are sharp and durable, promising longevity. However, the plastic jar feels a bit flimsy, which makes me wary of its long-term durability. Overall, it's a great performer, but I wish the jar felt more robust.\n\nThis pair of running shoes has been a game changer for my workouts. The cushioning is fantastic, providing comfort during long runs, and the grip on the sole is excellent, even on wet surfaces. However, I noticed that the mesh material started to fray after a few weeks of use, which is disappointing. Despite this, the overall performance is impressive, making them a solid choice for avid runners."
