The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must highlight specific quality aspects such as durability, craftsmanship, material feel, performance, or design flaws. Include precise details about the product type (e.g., smartphone, jacket, chair) and realistic usage scenarios (e.g., daily wear, heavy use, special events).

Ensure the review centers on tangible product attributes and outcomes, like 'the fabric tore after one wash' or 'the battery lasts impressively long,' to clearly distinguish it from other categories.",
