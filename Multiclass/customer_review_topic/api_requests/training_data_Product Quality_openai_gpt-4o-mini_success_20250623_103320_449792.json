  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) strictly focusing on the quality of a product, avoiding mentions of price, shipping, or customer service. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must highlight specific quality aspects such as durability, craftsmanship, material feel, performance, or design flaws. Include precise details about the product type (e.g., smartphone, jacket, chair) and realistic usage scenarios (e.g., daily wear, heavy use, special events). Vary the tone (e.g., enthusiastic, critical, balanced) and customer perspective (e.g., young professional, parent, hobbyist) to reflect diverse experiences. Ensure the review centers on tangible product attributes and outcomes, like 'the fabric tore after one wash' or 'the battery lasts impressively long,' to clearly distinguish it from other categories.",
  "response": "The leather jacket I purchased has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality. The craftsmanship is evident, with neat stitching and no loose threads. I've worn it daily for over a month, and it still looks brand new. The leather feels soft yet durable, and the interior lining is comfortable against the skin. It provides excellent warmth without being bulky, making it perfect for both casual outings and slightly dressier occasions. Overall, this jacket combines style with practicality, and I can see it lasting for years.\n\nI recently bought a high-end gaming chair, and while the design is sleek and modern, I was disappointed with the overall quality. After just a few weeks of use, the foam padding began to sag, affecting comfort during long gaming sessions. The armrests feel flimsy and don't offer enough support. I expected better durability for a chair marketed towards gamers. While it looks good in my setup, I can’t recommend it for heavy use due to these flaws.\n\nAs an avid photographer, I invested in a premium camera backpack and was thoroughly impressed by its quality. The material is water-resistant, providing peace of mind during outdoor shoots. The padding is well-placed, ensuring my camera gear is secure and protected. There are ample pockets for organization, and the zippers operate smoothly. I appreciate the thoughtful design, which makes accessing my equipment on-the-go seamless. This backpack is a solid investment for anyone serious about photography.\n\nI purchased a new set of kitchen knives, and the quality is outstanding. The blades are incredibly sharp and maintain their edge even after several uses. The handles feel comfortable and sturdy, which is important for extended periods of chopping. I’ve used them for everything from prepping vegetables to slicing meat, and they perform exceptionally well. The craftsmanship is top-notch, and I can tell they will last for many years in my kitchen.\n\nAfter trying a popular fitness tracker, I found its quality to be underwhelming. The plastic casing feels cheap, and the screen scratches easily even with minimal use. While the features are appealing, the tracker often struggles with accuracy, especially during workouts. I expected a more robust product since it’s designed for active individuals. Overall, it didn’t meet my expectations for quality, and I wouldn’t recommend it for serious fitness enthusiasts."
