  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was surprisingly easy for me. I bought a gadget that turned out to be defective, and I was relieved to find out that the store had a no-hassle return policy within 30 days. I printed the return label from their website and mailed it back without any issues. I received my refund within a week, which exceeded my expectations. However, my friend had a different experience. She received a wrong size in her clothing order and found the return policy unclear, which led to confusion about restocking fees. After much back and forth, she finally returned it in-store, but it took longer than she anticipated to get her refund processed. Overall, while my experience was very positive, hers was quite frustrating due to the policy's lack of clarity."
