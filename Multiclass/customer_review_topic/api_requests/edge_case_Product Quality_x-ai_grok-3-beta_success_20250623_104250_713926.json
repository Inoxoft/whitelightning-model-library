  "prompt": "\n**Goal:** Generate challenging examples for the class \"Product Quality\" for testing a multiclass_softmax classifier.\n\n**Problem Description:** Classify the topic of this customer review. Choose from: Product Quality, Customer Service, Shipping, Price, Return Policy, Ease of Use\n**All Class Labels:** ['Customer Service', 'Ease of Use', 'Price', 'Product Quality', 'Return Policy', 'Shipping']\n\n**Task:** Generate diverse text samples that ARE examples of \"Product Quality\" according to the Problem Description, but are intentionally designed to be difficult for a classifier to identify correctly. Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"Product Quality\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"Product Quality\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"Product Quality\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"Product Quality\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",
