  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing entirely on the price of a product or service, avoiding discussion of quality, shipping, or service interactions. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must evaluate aspects like perceived value, affordability, pricing fairness, or comparisons to alternatives. Include specific details about the item (e.g., subscription plan, kitchen appliance, apparel) and customer mindset (e.g., budget shopper, luxury seeker, student). Vary the tone (e.g., thrilled, disappointed, pragmatic) and purchase contexts (e.g., sale event, regular price, bundle deal) to capture diverse perspectives. Focus on price-related sentiments, such as 'worth every penny for the features' or 'way overpriced for what you get,' to ensure the review is distinctly tied to the price category and avoids overlap with other topics.",
  "response": "The new smartwatch I purchased is priced at $300, which I consider a bit steep compared to other models on the market. However, it includes features like heart rate monitoring and GPS that I find valuable for my fitness routine. While I was initially hesitant about the price, I believe it offers decent value for the technology packed into it. \n\nAs a college student, I was thrilled to find this high-quality backpack for just $40 during a back-to-school sale. The regular price was $70, which felt excessive for what is essentially a bag. The discounted price made it a worthwhile investment for my daily commute and classes.\n\nI recently bought a subscription to a meal kit service for $120 a month. While it’s more expensive than cooking from scratch, the convenience and variety make it feel fair. I often compare this price to takeout, and I find that I save money while enjoying home-cooked meals.\n\nI was disappointed when I discovered that the trendy sneakers I wanted were $150, which seemed way overpriced for what they offered. I found similar styles for $80 elsewhere, making me question if the brand’s name justified the high price tag.\n\nAt $250, the premium blender seemed like a luxury I couldn’t afford, but after using it for a few months, I can confidently say it was worth every penny. I use it daily for smoothies and soups, and it's held up beautifully, proving that sometimes you get what you pay for.\n\nI recently splurged on a designer handbag priced at $800, which I justified as a long-term investment. While it’s certainly a luxury purchase, the craftsmanship and timeless design make me feel it’s a fair price for something I’ll use for years.\n\nI found an online course for $200 that promised to teach valuable skills, but I felt it was overpriced compared to free resources available. I opted not to enroll, choosing instead to invest my time in exploring free tutorials that cover similar content.\n\nThe fitness tracker I bought was on sale for $60, down from $100. I was very pleased with the deal, particularly since I had been eyeing it for a while. Getting it at this price made me feel like I got a great value for a device that helps me monitor my health.\n\nI was excited to see a local restaurant offering a meal deal for $30, which included an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Given the quality of the food, I felt the price was very reasonable and a great way to enjoy a night out without breaking the bank.\n\nAfter trying several subscription boxes, I found one priced at $40 a month that offers curated items I genuinely love. Compared to others that felt like a waste of money, this one feels like a fair price for the unique products I receive each month."
