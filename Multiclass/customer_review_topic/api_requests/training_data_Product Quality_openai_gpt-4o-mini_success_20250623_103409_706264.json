  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) strictly focusing on the quality of a product, avoiding mentions of price, shipping, or customer service. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must highlight specific quality aspects such as durability, craftsmanship, material feel, performance, or design flaws. Include precise details about the product type (e.g., smartphone, jacket, chair) and realistic usage scenarios (e.g., daily wear, heavy use, special events). Vary the tone (e.g., enthusiastic, critical, balanced) and customer perspective (e.g., young professional, parent, hobbyist) to reflect diverse experiences. Ensure the review centers on tangible product attributes and outcomes, like 'the fabric tore after one wash' or 'the battery lasts impressively long,' to clearly distinguish it from other categories.",
  "response": "The new ceramic non-stick frying pan exceeded my expectations with its exceptional performance. After several weeks of daily use, I can confidently say that the non-stick surface is truly remarkable; eggs slide out effortlessly without any residue. The pan heats evenly, eliminating hot spots, which is perfect for my morning omelets. The craftsmanship is evident in the sturdy handle that remains cool to the touch. However, I did notice some scratches after using metal utensils, so I recommend being cautious with your tools. Overall, this frying pan has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. \n\nI recently purchased a leather jacket, and while the design initially caught my eye, the quality has been disappointing. After just a month of occasional wear, I noticed the stitching on the cuffs has started to unravel. The leather feels soft and luxurious, but it doesn’t seem durable enough for everyday use, especially given the climate here. I had hoped it would age beautifully, but I’m concerned about its longevity. It’s a stylish piece, but I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone looking for a reliable jacket for regular wear. \n\nThe wireless earbuds I bought have transformed my daily commute. The sound quality is impressive, with deep bass and clear vocals, making my playlists more enjoyable. They fit snugly in my ears, even during my morning jog, and I appreciate the passive noise isolation they provide. The battery life is outstanding; I can go several days without charging them. However, I did find the touch controls a bit sensitive, leading to accidental pauses during calls. Overall, these earbuds are a great addition to my routine, offering both comfort and excellent audio performance. \n\nI’ve been using a yoga mat for about six months, and I’m quite impressed with its quality. The material has a great grip, which prevents slipping during poses, and I’ve noticed no wear and tear despite frequent use. It’s thick enough to provide comfort during kneeling positions, yet still allows for stability in standing poses. The color and design are also aesthetically pleasing, making my workout space feel inviting. However, I do wish it were a bit lighter for easier transport to classes. Overall, a solid investment for any yoga enthusiast. \n\nThe stainless steel water bottle I bought is both stylish and functional. The double-wall insulation keeps my drinks cold for hours, which is perfect for hot summer days. The material feels robust and high-quality, with no signs of dents or scratches after a month of heavy use. I love the wide mouth opening, making it easy to add ice cubes and clean. However, the cap can be a bit tricky to screw on tightly, leading to occasional leaks. Despite this small issue, it has become my go-to bottle for workouts and daily hydration."
