  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was incredibly straightforward. I mistakenly ordered the wrong size for a pair of shoes, and I was relieved to find their policy allowed for no-hassle returns within 30 days. I printed the label from their website and dropped the package off at the post office. The refund was processed within a week, which was quicker than I expected. \n\nOn the other hand, my experience returning a defective phone was less than ideal. The fine print mentioned a 15% restocking fee if opened, which I wasn't aware of. I ended up losing money on that return, and the entire process felt confusing. Overall, while I appreciate the easy return method for clothing, my gadget return left me frustrated due to the unclear policy details.\n\nHaving returned items frequently, I found their in-store drop-off convenient, but I wish they provided clearer instructions online. The return process is generally user-friendly, but I encountered some hurdles that could be improved."
