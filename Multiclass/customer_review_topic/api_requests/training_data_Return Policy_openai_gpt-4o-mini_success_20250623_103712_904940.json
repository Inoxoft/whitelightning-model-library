  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was surprisingly straightforward. I ordered a pair of shoes that turned out to be the wrong size, but initiating the return was as simple as clicking a link in my order confirmation email. I printed the label and dropped it off at the nearest shipping center. I received my refund within five days of the return being processed. It was a hassle-free experience, and the clear instructions made it easy for a first-time buyer like me.\n\nI was disappointed with the return policy. After receiving a defective gadget, I expected a simple return, but the fine print stated that returns must be initiated within just 14 days. I missed the window by a couple of days and was denied a refund. The process felt frustrating and overly complicated, making me hesitant to purchase from them again.\n\nReturning a gift was more difficult than I anticipated. The website didn't clearly state their return policy, and I was shocked to find out there was a 20% restocking fee. I ended up mailing it back, which added to the hassle. I wouldn't recommend this store for gift purchases unless you’re certain the recipient will keep it.\n\nAs a frequent returner, I appreciated their no-hassle refund within 30 days policy. I recently returned a jacket that just didn’t fit right. I was able to drop it off at a local store without any issues. The refund appeared in my account just two days later. It’s nice to know I can shop with confidence.\n\nI found the return process to be a bit confusing. I received an unwanted gift and wanted to return it, but the instructions were scattered across different pages on their website.

I’d definitely shop here again. \n\nAfter purchasing a faulty appliance, I was relieved to see they offered a 30-day return policy. I initiated the return online and received a shipping label right away. It did take a while to process the refund, but I was kept updated throughout the entire process. Overall, a solid experience.\n\nI had a negative experience with their return policy. I received a pair of pants that were the wrong size, and although I followed their return instructions, the fine print about not accepting returns for sale items caught me off guard. I ended up losing money on a purchase that I thought would be easy to fix. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the return process. I needed to return a dress I bought for an event that was too big.

It felt like I was penalized for returning something I didn’t order myself, which was disappointing. \n\nThe return process was efficient and straightforward.
