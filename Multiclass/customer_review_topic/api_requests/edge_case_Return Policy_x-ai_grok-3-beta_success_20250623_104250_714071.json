  "prompt": "\n**Goal:** Generate challenging examples for the class \"Return Policy\" for testing a multiclass_softmax classifier.\n\n**Problem Description:** Classify the topic of this customer review. Choose from: Product Quality, Customer Service, Shipping, Price, Return Policy, Ease of Use\n**All Class Labels:** ['Customer Service', 'Ease of Use', 'Price', 'Product Quality', 'Return Policy', 'Shipping']\n\n**Task:** Generate diverse text samples that ARE examples of \"Return Policy\" according to the Problem Description, but are intentionally designed to be difficult for a classifier to identify correctly. Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"Return Policy\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"Return Policy\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"Return Policy\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"Return Policy\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",
  "response": "{\n    \"1\": \"I was pretty annoyed with how things turned out after I decided to send the item back. The whole process just felt unnecessarily complicated, though I guess I got my money eventually.\",\n    \"2\": \"Not sure if I’m happy with the way they handled my request to exchange the product. It took forever to even get a response, and I’m still waiting on some clarity about the refund.\",\n    \"3\": \"I had an issue with the gadget not working as expected, and while I reached out to get a replacement, the back-and-forth emails were a hassle. Eventually, they agreed to take it back.\",\n    \"4\": \"The item didn’t fit my needs, so I figured I’d try to reverse the purchase. Honestly, their system for this kind of thing is buried deep in fine print, which made it a pain.\",\n    \"5\": \"I wasn’t thrilled with the product and thought about initiating a reversal of the transaction. Their website has a section for this, but it’s so vague I almost gave up trying.\",\n    \"6\": \"After using it for a day, I realized it wasn’t for me. Getting it sent back to the company was like solving a puzzle—too many steps and unclear instructions.\",\n    \"7\": \"I had to deal with their protocol for returning stuff, and while the item itself was decent, I’m not sure I’d go through that tedious procedure again. It left a bad taste.\",\n    \"8\": \"The device broke within a week, and while I wanted a new one, the focus shifted to how I could ship it back. That part of the experience was more frustrating than the broken item.\",\n    \"9\": \"I tried to undo my order after noticing a defect, but the guidelines for doing so were so convoluted that I spent hours just figuring out the first step.\",\n    \"10\": \"When the product arrived damaged, I knew I couldn’t keep it. The real struggle was navigating their so-called ‘hassle-free’ process to get it returned—definitely not hassle-free.\"\n}"
