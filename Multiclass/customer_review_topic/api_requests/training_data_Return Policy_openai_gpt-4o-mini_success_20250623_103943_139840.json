  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was surprisingly straightforward. I received a gift that wasn’t my style, and I was relieved to find they offer a no-hassle return within 30 days. I initiated the return through their website, printed the label, and dropped it off at the nearest location. The refund was processed within a week, which exceeded my expectations. \n\nHowever, my experience was quite different when I tried to return a defective gadget. The website mentioned a 14-day return policy, but the fine print stated that items marked as final sale couldn’t be returned. It took several emails to clarify this, and I felt frustrated with the lack of transparency. \n\nAs a first-time user, I appreciated the clear instructions for returning clothing that didn’t fit, but I wish I had known about the 20% restocking fee for opened items. Overall, the ease of initiating the process was a plus, but the hidden fees left me feeling less than satisfied."
