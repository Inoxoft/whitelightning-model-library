  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) exclusively focusing on the customer service experience, avoiding mentions of product quality, shipping, or pricing. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must detail specific interactions with staff or support teams, such as their responsiveness, empathy, problem-solving ability, or rudeness. Include varied scenarios (e.g., resolving a missing order, handling a warranty claim, in-store assistance) and communication channels (e.g., email, live chat, phone). Vary the tone (e.g., grateful, angry, indifferent) and customer background (e.g., first-time buyer, loyal customer) to capture diverse emotions and contexts. Focus on the human or procedural elements of service, like 'the agent stayed on the line until my issue was fixed' or 'I waited hours for a response,' to ensure clear class distinction.",
  "response": "The customer service I experienced was outstanding. When I had an issue with my order being misplaced, I reached out via live chat. The representative was incredibly empathetic and assured me they would resolve the problem. They kept me updated throughout the process, which made me feel valued as a customer. I appreciate how they took the time to listen to my concerns and provided a quick solution.\n\nOn the other hand, my recent experience was quite frustrating.

It took several days to get a response, and when I finally did, it felt generic and unhelpful. I expected more from a company that prides itself on customer service.\n\nAfter being a loyal customer for years, I was disappointed during my last interaction.
