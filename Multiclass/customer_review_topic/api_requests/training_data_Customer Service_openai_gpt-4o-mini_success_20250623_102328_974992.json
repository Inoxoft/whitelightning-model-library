  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) exclusively focusing on the customer service experience, avoiding mentions of product quality, shipping, or pricing. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must detail specific interactions with staff or support teams, such as their responsiveness, empathy, problem-solving ability, or rudeness. Include varied scenarios (e.g., resolving a missing order, handling a warranty claim, in-store assistance) and communication channels (e.g., email, live chat, phone). Vary the tone (e.g., grateful, angry, indifferent) and customer background (e.g., first-time buyer, loyal customer) to capture diverse emotions and contexts. Focus on the human or procedural elements of service, like 'the agent stayed on the line until my issue was fixed' or 'I waited hours for a response,' to ensure clear class distinction.",

The staff were polite, but they seemed overwhelmed and took a while to address my questions.

The agent was knowledgeable and answered all my questions promptly, making my first experience a positive one.

They patiently explained everything and followed up to ensure I understood the corrections made.

The support team was slow to respond to my inquiry, and when I finally received an answer, it lacked clarity. I felt like I was left in the dark.\n\nThe in-store assistance I received was top-notch. The staff were attentive and went out of their way to ensure I found exactly what I needed. Their friendly demeanor made shopping a breeze.\n\nI reached out via their live chat for help with a technical issue, and while the agent was polite, the solutions provided were generic and didn’t solve my problem.
