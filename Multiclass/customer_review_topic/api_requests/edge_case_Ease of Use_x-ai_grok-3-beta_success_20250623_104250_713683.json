  "prompt": "\n**Goal:** Generate challenging examples for the class \"Ease of Use\" for testing a multiclass_softmax classifier.\n\n**Problem Description:** Classify the topic of this customer review. Choose from: Product Quality, Customer Service, Shipping, Price, Return Policy, Ease of Use\n**All Class Labels:** ['Customer Service', 'Ease of Use', 'Price', 'Product Quality', 'Return Policy', 'Shipping']\n\n**Task:** Generate diverse text samples that ARE examples of \"Ease of Use\" according to the Problem Description, but are intentionally designed to be difficult for a classifier to identify correctly. Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"Ease of Use\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"Ease of Use\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"Ease of Use\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"Ease of Use\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"1\": \"I was surprised by how the setup process went, though it took some poking around to figure out the initial steps. Once I got it going, everything seemed to fall into place without much hassle.\",\n  \"2\": \"The item’s design feels intuitive in a way, but I wouldn’t say it’s immediately obvious how to get started. After a bit of trial and error, I managed to navigate through the basics.\",\n  \"3\": \"It’s not exactly a walk in the park to operate this thing at first glance, but somehow I muddled through the instructions and got it working without breaking a sweat.\",\n  \"4\": \"The whole experience of using this product is tied to how quickly you adapt to its quirks. I’m still not sure if it’s user-friendly or if I just got lucky figuring it out.\",\n  \"5\": \"Getting accustomed to this gadget was less of a chore than I expected, though I had to tinker with it for a while before things clicked. Not sure if that’s a plus or a minus.\",\n  \"6\": \"There’s a bit of a learning curve here, but once you get past the initial fumbling, it’s not too bad to handle. I’m still on the fence about calling it straightforward.\",\n  \"7\": \"I wouldn’t say it’s a breeze to work with this, but after some head-scratching, I sorted out how to make it function. Could’ve been worse, I suppose.\",\n  \"8\": \"The way this is set up, you’d think it’s a puzzle at first. But after a few missteps, I got the hang of it—barely. Not sure if that counts as easy or just doable.\",\n  \"9\": \"Navigating the features of this item felt like decoding a manual in another language initially, but I managed to piece it together eventually. Still, it wasn’t seamless.\",\n  \"10\": \"I had to wrestle with the setup a bit, but once I cracked the code, using it wasn’t as daunting as I feared. Still, I wouldn’t call it a plug-and-play experience.\"\n}"
