  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process for my recent purchase was surprisingly easy. I received a pair of shoes that were the wrong size as a gift, and I was relieved to find the return policy clearly outlined on the website. I initiated the return online, printed the shipping label, and mailed them back without any hassle. The refund was processed within five days, which exceeded my expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, my experience with returning a defective gadget was far less pleasant. The policy stated a 30-day return window, but I found the fine print confusing, leading to my return being denied despite my efforts to follow the guidelines. I felt frustrated as I had to reach out multiple times to clarify the situation.\n\nAs a frequent returner, I appreciate when a company makes the process straightforward, which is why I was so pleased with the clothing return. I simply dropped it off at the store, and my refund was issued immediately. Overall, return experiences seem to vary widely based on the specifics of the policy and the situation."
