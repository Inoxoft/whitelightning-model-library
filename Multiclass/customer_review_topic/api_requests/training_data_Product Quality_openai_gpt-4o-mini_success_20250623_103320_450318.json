  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) strictly focusing on the quality of a product, avoiding mentions of price, shipping, or customer service. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must highlight specific quality aspects such as durability, craftsmanship, material feel, performance, or design flaws. Include precise details about the product type (e.g., smartphone, jacket, chair) and realistic usage scenarios (e.g., daily wear, heavy use, special events). Vary the tone (e.g., enthusiastic, critical, balanced) and customer perspective (e.g., young professional, parent, hobbyist) to reflect diverse experiences. Ensure the review centers on tangible product attributes and outcomes, like 'the fabric tore after one wash' or 'the battery lasts impressively long,' to clearly distinguish it from other categories.",
