  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) strictly focusing on the quality of a product, avoiding mentions of price, shipping, or customer service. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must highlight specific quality aspects such as durability, craftsmanship, material feel, performance, or design flaws. Include precise details about the product type (e.g., smartphone, jacket, chair) and realistic usage scenarios (e.g., daily wear, heavy use, special events). Vary the tone (e.g., enthusiastic, critical, balanced) and customer perspective (e.g., young professional, parent, hobbyist) to reflect diverse experiences. Ensure the review centers on tangible product attributes and outcomes, like 'the fabric tore after one wash' or 'the battery lasts impressively long,' to clearly distinguish it from other categories.",
  "response": "The new smartphone I purchased has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance and design. The sleek glass finish makes it feel premium, while the advanced camera captures stunning photos even in low light. After a month of heavy daily use, the battery life remains impressive, lasting well over a day. The responsiveness of the touchscreen is top-notch, making navigation seamless and enjoyable. \n\nI recently tried a new jacket for outdoor activities, and while the style is trendy, I found the quality lacking.

It picks up pet hair and debris effortlessly, and the suction power remains strong even after multiple uses. The lightweight design makes it easy to maneuver around my home. I’m particularly impressed by the washable filter, which simplifies maintenance.\n\nI tried a new air fryer, and the cooking quality is impressive. The food comes out crispy and evenly cooked, while the non-stick basket makes cleanup a breeze. The design is sleek and modern, fitting well in my kitchen. However, I wish the capacity was larger, as I often find myself cooking in batches.\n\nI recently purchased a new set of towels, and I’m very pleased with their softness and absorbency. After several washes, they still feel plush and haven’t lost their color. The quality of the fabric is evident, making them a luxurious addition to my bathroom. I appreciate that they dry quickly after use.\n\nThe quality of the new desk lamp I bought is commendable. The adjustable brightness settings allow for perfect lighting, whether I’m reading or working. The design is modern and fits well with my office decor. I’m especially impressed with the stability of the base, which prevents it from tipping over easily.\n\nI recently bought a set of cookware, and the quality stands out.

The scent is pleasant, and it did hydrate my skin, but I need something lighter for daily use.\n\nI bought a new set of dinner plates, and the quality is impressive.

I’m very happy with this purchase.\n\nI was excited about a new electric kettle, but I found it lacking in quality.
