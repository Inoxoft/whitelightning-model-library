  "prompt": "\n**Goal:** Generate challenging examples for the class \"Customer Service\" for testing a multiclass_softmax classifier.\n\n**Problem Description:** Classify the topic of this customer review. Choose from: Product Quality, Customer Service, Shipping, Price, Return Policy, Ease of Use\n**All Class Labels:** ['Customer Service', 'Ease of Use', 'Price', 'Product Quality', 'Return Policy', 'Shipping']\n\n**Task:** Generate diverse text samples that ARE examples of \"Customer Service\" according to the Problem Description, but are intentionally designed to be difficult for a classifier to identify correctly. Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"Customer Service\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"Customer Service\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"Customer Service\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"Customer Service\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",
  "response": "{\n  \"1\": \"I had an issue with my order, but after a quick chat, it was sorted out. Honestly, I’m more impressed with the product itself than anything else.\",\n  \"2\": \"The website was a breeze to navigate, and while I did have a small query, it was handled promptly. Still, the real highlight was how intuitive everything felt.\",\n  \"3\": \"I wasn’t sure about the sizing, so I reached out. They got back to me eventually, though I’m mostly just thrilled with how affordable this turned out to be.\",\n  \"4\": \"Had to contact someone regarding a mix-up with my purchase. The resolution was adequate, but I’m really just happy with how fast the item arrived.\",\n  \"5\": \"There was a minor glitch with my account, and while it took a bit of back-and-forth to fix, I can’t stop raving about the item’s durability and design.\",\n  \"6\": \"I needed clarification on a policy, and the response I got was... okay, I guess. What really matters is how well the product works for me day-to-day.\",\n  \"7\": \"Reached out about a billing concern, and they dealt with it quietly. Frankly, my main takeaway is how seamless the whole checkout process was.\",\n  \"8\": \"I had to ping their team about a small error in my order details. It was resolved without much fuss, though I’m mostly blown away by the packaging speed.\",\n  \"9\": \"There was a tiny hiccup with my request, and while they addressed it, I barely noticed because the item’s quality just stole the show completely.\",\n  \"10\": \"I dropped a line to inquire about something trivial related to my purchase. Got a reply, nothing special. What’s truly remarkable is how cheap this was.\"\n}"
