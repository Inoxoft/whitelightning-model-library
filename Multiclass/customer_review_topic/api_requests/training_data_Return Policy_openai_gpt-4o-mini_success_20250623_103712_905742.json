  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was surprisingly straightforward. I received a shirt that was the wrong size as a gift, and the return policy stated I could initiate the return online. I printed the label, dropped it off at the post office, and received my refund within a week. I appreciated the clear instructions and no restocking fees. \n\nHowever, my experience with returning a defective gadget was less pleasant. The policy mentioned a 15-day window for returns, but I found the fine print confusing, which led to a denial of my refund request. I had to call customer service several times for clarifications, which was frustrating. \n\nOn the other hand, as a frequent online shopper, I was relieved when I initiated a return for a pair of shoes that didnâ€™t fit. The website was easy to navigate, and I was able to drop them off at a local store. I received my refund in just a few days with no hassle, which was refreshing. \n\nOverall, while I had mixed experiences, the ease of returning items varied greatly based on the specific policies of the product category."
