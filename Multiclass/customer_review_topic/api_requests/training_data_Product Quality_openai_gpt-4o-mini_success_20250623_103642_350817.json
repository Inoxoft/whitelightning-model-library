  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) strictly focusing on the quality of a product, avoiding mentions of price, shipping, or customer service. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must highlight specific quality aspects such as durability, craftsmanship, material feel, performance, or design flaws. Include precise details about the product type (e.g., smartphone, jacket, chair) and realistic usage scenarios (e.g., daily wear, heavy use, special events). Vary the tone (e.g., enthusiastic, critical, balanced) and customer perspective (e.g., young professional, parent, hobbyist) to reflect diverse experiences. Ensure the review centers on tangible product attributes and outcomes, like 'the fabric tore after one wash' or 'the battery lasts impressively long,' to clearly distinguish it from other categories.",
  "response": "The leather jacket I purchased has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality. The craftsmanship is excellent, with intricate stitching that feels sturdy and durable. I've worn it daily for a month, and the material has only softened beautifully without showing any signs of wear. The inner lining is also smooth, making it comfortable to wear over long periods. However, the design could be improved; the pockets are a bit shallow, which makes it hard to carry my phone securely. Overall, this jacket is a great addition to my wardrobe for both casual outings and special events.\n\nI bought a ceramic coffee mug that has become my favorite for morning brews. The glaze is flawless, giving it a beautiful shine that hasn’t faded with multiple washes. It retains heat exceptionally well, keeping my coffee warm for longer than any other mug I've owned. However, I did notice a small chip on the rim after just a few weeks of use, which takes away from its otherwise perfect design. Overall, it’s a lovely mug, but I wish it was a bit more robust against everyday accidents.\n\nThe performance of my new wireless headphones has been impressive. The sound quality is crisp, with deep bass that enhances my music experience. I've used them during workouts and commutes, and they stay securely in place without any discomfort. The battery life is also noteworthy, lasting up to 20 hours on a single charge; I rarely need to recharge them. The only downside is the plastic casing, which feels a bit cheap compared to the high-end audio quality. Nevertheless, they're a solid choice for anyone looking for reliable headphones.\n\nI recently purchased a wooden dining table that has truly transformed my eating space. The natural grain patterns are stunning, making it a centerpiece in my home. The construction feels solid, and it withstands heavy use without wobbling. I appreciate how easy it is to clean, as spills wipe away without leaving marks. However, I did notice that the finish could be more resistant to scratches, as I've seen a few minor ones after just a couple of months. Overall, it’s a beautiful and functional piece that fits my family’s needs well.\n\nThe running shoes I bought have been a game changer for my daily jogs. The cushioning is superb, providing excellent support for my feet during long distances. The breathable mesh material keeps my feet cool, even on warmer days. I've used them extensively for over three months, and they still feel as if they’re brand new. However, I would have preferred a more reflective material for night runs. Still, the overall performance and comfort make these shoes a fantastic investment for runners."
