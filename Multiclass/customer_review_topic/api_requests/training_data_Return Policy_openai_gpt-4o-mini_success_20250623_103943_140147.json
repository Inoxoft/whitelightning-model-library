  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return policy at this store was surprisingly straightforward. I had to return a defective gadget, and the process was seamless. I simply printed the return label from their website and dropped it off at the post office. Within five days, I received a full refund, no questions asked. It was a relief to see such a no-hassle return policy, especially since I’ve dealt with more complicated processes elsewhere.\n\nOn the other hand, my experience with returning a wrong size clothing item was less than ideal. The website had confusing fine print, which stated that I would incur a restocking fee if I returned items beyond 30 days. I didn’t realize this until my return was denied. Overall, it left me frustrated with their lack of clarity.\n\nAs a first-time user, I appreciated the in-store drop-off option for an unwanted gift. The staff was helpful in processing the return quickly, and I didn’t need to worry about shipping costs. However, I would recommend clarifying the return window on the receipt to avoid any surprises later.\n\nLastly, as a frequent returner, I was pleased to find that this store offers a no-hassle refund policy within 30 days. Each time I’ve returned something, the process has been simple, and I received my money back swiftly. It’s reassuring to know I can shop here without fear of being stuck with something I don’t want."
