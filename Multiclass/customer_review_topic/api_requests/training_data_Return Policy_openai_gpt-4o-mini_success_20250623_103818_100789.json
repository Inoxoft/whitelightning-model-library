  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process for this store was surprisingly straightforward. I received a defective gadget and was relieved to find that their no-hassle return policy allowed me to initiate a return online with just a few clicks. I printed the label, packaged the item, and dropped it off at the post office. Within five days, I received my refund, which exceeded my expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, I had a frustrating experience returning a sweater that was the wrong size. The fine print on their website mentioned a 15% restocking fee that I overlooked, so when my refund was processed, it was much less than I anticipated. The return was easy to start, but I felt misled by the lack of clarity in their policy.\n\nAs a frequent returner, I've seen better policies elsewhere. I would recommend checking the details carefully before making a purchase here. \n\nFor my first-time experience, returning a gift was a breeze. I took the item to the store and received a store credit without any hassle, which made my shopping much easier. Overall, while some aspects were smooth, others left me feeling cautious."
