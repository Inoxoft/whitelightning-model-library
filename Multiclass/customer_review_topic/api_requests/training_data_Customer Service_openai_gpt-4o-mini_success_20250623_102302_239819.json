  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) exclusively focusing on the customer service experience, avoiding mentions of product quality, shipping, or pricing. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must detail specific interactions with staff or support teams, such as their responsiveness, empathy, problem-solving ability, or rudeness. Include varied scenarios (e.g., resolving a missing order, handling a warranty claim, in-store assistance) and communication channels (e.g., email, live chat, phone). Vary the tone (e.g., grateful, angry, indifferent) and customer background (e.g., first-time buyer, loyal customer) to capture diverse emotions and contexts. Focus on the human or procedural elements of service, like 'the agent stayed on the line until my issue was fixed' or 'I waited hours for a response,' to ensure clear class distinction.",
  "response": "The customer service at this store was outstanding. I had an issue with a missing order and contacted their support team via live chat. The agent was incredibly empathetic and stayed with me until my problem was resolved, even checking back to ensure everything was okay. As a first-time buyer, I felt valued and appreciated.\n\nI was really disappointed with my experience when I called about a warranty claim. The representative I spoke to was rude and seemed uninterested in helping me. After waiting on hold for over 30 minutes, I expected a better attitude. It left me feeling frustrated and disheartened.\n\nI reached out via email to ask about an in-store promotion I had seen. The response was quick, but the information provided was vague and unhelpful. I appreciate the prompt reply, but I needed more clarity. Overall, it was a neutral experience.\n\nAs a long-time customer, I always expect great service, but my last visit was a letdown. The staff seemed overwhelmed and took a long time to assist me. I waited for nearly 20 minutes without a follow-up, which was disappointing.\n\nI had a fantastic experience when I called customer service about a billing issue. The agent was patient and took the time to explain everything clearly. They even offered to follow up with me to ensure the problem was fully resolved. I felt really cared for during the interaction."
