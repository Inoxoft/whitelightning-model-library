  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was incredibly straightforward. I received a defective gadget and was relieved to find a no-hassle refund policy within 30 days. Initiating the return online was a breeze; I printed the label and dropped it in the mail. My refund was processed within a week, which exceeded my expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, my experience returning a pair of shoes that were the wrong size was less than ideal. The website had confusing fine print about restocking fees, and I ended up losing 15% of my refund. It felt frustrating as a first-time user. \n\nAfter receiving an unwanted gift, I decided to drop it off at the store. The staff was helpful, but I was surprised there was no cash refund option, only store credit. Overall, the clarity of the return policy varied significantly based on the product and method."
