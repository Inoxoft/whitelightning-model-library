  "class_label": "Return Policy",
  "status": "success",
  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing strictly on the return policy or process, excluding mentions of product quality, shipping delays, or customer service attitude. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must describe specific experiences with returns, such as policy clarity, ease of initiating a return, refund processing time, or restocking fees. Include varied scenarios (e.g., returning a defective gadget, wrong size clothing, unwanted gift) and return methods (e.g., mail-in, in-store drop-off). Vary the tone (e.g., relieved, frustrated, neutral) and customer types (e.g., frequent returner, first-time user) to reflect diverse experiences. Highlight policy-specific details, like 'no-hassle refund within 30 days' or 'confusing fine print led to denial,' to ensure the review is uniquely tied to the return process and distinct from other categories.",
  "response": "The return process was straightforward and hassle-free. I received a defective gadget and was pleasantly surprised to find that I could initiate the return online without any complications. They offered a no-hassle refund within 30 days, and I received my money back within a week of sending the item back. However, my friend had a different experience when she received a shirt in the wrong size. Although the website stated free returns, she was shocked to find a restocking fee mentioned in the fine print, which made her feel misled. I've returned items before with other retailers, but this was my first time with this company, and I appreciated their clarity and efficiency. Overall, I would recommend them for their easy return policy but advise checking the details closely."
