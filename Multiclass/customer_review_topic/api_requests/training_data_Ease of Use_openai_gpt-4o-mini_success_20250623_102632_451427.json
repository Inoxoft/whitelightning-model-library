  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing exclusively on the ease of use of a product or service, avoiding references to quality, price, or support interactions. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must address specific usability aspects like intuitiveness, setup complexity, instruction clarity, or accessibility. Include details about the product (e.g., app, power tool, fitness equipment) and usage context (e.g., home, travel, professional setting). Vary the tone (e.g., impressed, irritated, ambivalent) and user backgrounds (e.g., tech novice, elderly user, expert) to capture diverse challenges or successes. Focus on usability-specific feedback, such as 'the interface was a breeze to navigate' or 'took hours to figure out the settings,' to clearly distinguish this category from others like product quality or customer service.",
  "response": "The new fitness tracker has been a breeze to set up. I’m not very tech-savvy, but the app guided me through each step effortlessly. The interface is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through my daily stats. I love how I can sync it to my phone without any hassle. \n\nAs a professional graphic designer, I found the new drawing tablet easy to use. The setup took less than ten minutes, and the instructions were clear. The pressure sensitivity felt natural right away, allowing me to jump into my projects without any frustrating adjustments. \n\nI was quite irritated with the smart home device. The setup process was convoluted, and the instructions left me confused. It took me hours to figure out how to connect it to my Wi-Fi, and even then, the interface didn’t feel user-friendly.\n\nAs an elderly user, I appreciate how straightforward the e-reader is. The large buttons and simple menu layout made it easy for me to find my favorite books without any stress. The font size adjustment is especially helpful, making reading much more enjoyable.\n\nI was ambivalent about the new project management software. While the interface looks sleek, I found the navigation a bit clunky. It took longer than expected to find basic features, and the help section didn’t clarify much. I wish they’d focus more on usability.\n\nThe travel app I downloaded was surprisingly easy to use. From booking flights to finding local attractions, everything felt straightforward. The map feature was particularly helpful, making it easy to explore new cities without getting lost.\n\nAs a tech novice, I struggled with the setup of the new smart thermostat. The instructions were not very clear, and I felt overwhelmed by the options. It took a while before I could get it to work properly, which was frustrating.\n\nThe photo editing software has an incredibly intuitive interface. I was able to start editing my pictures within minutes of installing it. The tooltips helped me understand what each function did, making the whole experience enjoyable.\n\nI was impressed with how user-friendly the new language learning app is. The lessons are structured well, and I love how it tracks my progress effortlessly. The interface is clean and makes learning fun without any unnecessary distractions.\n\nSetting up the new power tool was a nightmare. The manual was poorly written, and I spent hours trying to figure out how to put it together. Once I did manage to get it working, I was still left feeling frustrated by the lack of clarity in the instructions."
