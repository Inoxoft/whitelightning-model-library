  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) exclusively focusing on the customer service experience, avoiding mentions of product quality, shipping, or pricing. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must detail specific interactions with staff or support teams, such as their responsiveness, empathy, problem-solving ability, or rudeness. Include varied scenarios (e.g., resolving a missing order, handling a warranty claim, in-store assistance) and communication channels (e.g., email, live chat, phone). Vary the tone (e.g., grateful, angry, indifferent) and customer background (e.g., first-time buyer, loyal customer) to capture diverse emotions and contexts. Focus on the human or procedural elements of service, like 'the agent stayed on the line until my issue was fixed' or 'I waited hours for a response,' to ensure clear class distinction.",
