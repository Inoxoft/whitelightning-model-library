  "prompt": "Generate a customer review text (50-150 words) focusing exclusively on the ease of use of a product or service, avoiding references to quality, price, or support interactions. The review can be positive, negative, or neutral, and must address specific usability aspects like intuitiveness, setup complexity, instruction clarity, or accessibility. Include details about the product (e.g., app, power tool, fitness equipment) and usage context (e.g., home, travel, professional setting). Vary the tone (e.g., impressed, irritated, ambivalent) and user backgrounds (e.g., tech novice, elderly user, expert) to capture diverse challenges or successes. Focus on usability-specific feedback, such as 'the interface was a breeze to navigate' or 'took hours to figure out the settings,' to clearly distinguish this category from others like product quality or customer service.",
