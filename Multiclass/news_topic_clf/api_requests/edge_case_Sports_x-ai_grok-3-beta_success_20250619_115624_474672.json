  "prompt": "\n**Goal:** Generate challenging examples for the class \"Sports\" for testing a multiclass_softmax classifier.\n\n**Problem Description:** Classify news topic into the following categories: Politics, Health, Sports, Business\n**All Class Labels:** ['Business', 'Health', 'Politics', 'Sports']\n\n**Task:** Generate diverse text samples that ARE examples of \"Sports\" according to the Problem Description, but are intentionally designed to be difficult for a classifier to identify correctly. Focus on:\n*   Borderline cases that barely meet the \"Sports\" criteria.\n*   Examples disguised to look like other classes (e.g., subtle \"Sports\" signals).\n*   Samples using unusual phrasing, jargon, or obfuscation related to the \"Sports\" class.\n*   Ambiguous examples that require careful reading to identify as \"Sports\".\n\nGenerate only the text samples, in json format using numbers as keys. Do not add labels or explanations. Samples should be in english language.\n",
