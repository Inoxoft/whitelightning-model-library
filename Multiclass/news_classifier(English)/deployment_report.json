Democrats are pushing for increased spending on social programs, while Republicans are insisting on stricter immigration controls.

Researchers analyzed data from over 2,000 children and found that those who spent more than 3 hours per day on screens were 2.5 times more likely to develop myopia than those who spent less than 1 hour per day on screens. The study's lead author warns that parents and caregivers should be mindful of their children's screen time and encourage regular outdoor activities to reduce the risk of myopia.\"",
